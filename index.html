At the same time, it was the catalyst for unprecedented labor strife and environmental desecration. In this richly detailed history, Katherine G. Aiken traces Bunker Hill&#x2019;s evolution from the mine&#x2019;s discovery in 1885 to the company&#x2019;s closure in 1981.</p> <p>Throughout the company&#x2019;s long history, management&#x2019;s relentless pursuit of profit and the labor-management conflicts that often resulted were nothing short of legendary. Often a tale of strife, Bunker Hill&#x2019;s history is at the same time a story of cooperation, dedication, and ingenuity. People literally gave their lives for the production of lead, zinc, and silver. In the end, however, environmental destruction, aging facilities, and mineral shortages, as well as foreign competition, crippled the company&#x2019;s economic viability. Aiken offers an in-depth profile that illustrates major trends in American corporate culture.</p></p><p><p><strong>Katherine G.

At the beginning of Philip IV&#x2019;s reign, Spanish dominions were vast, not only in Europe but also in South America, Asia and Africa. The defense policy of such vast territories was established in the XVI century and consisted of the deployment of two core armies, in the Low Countries and in north Italy, the maintenance of strategic garrisons, and of fleets in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean to control communications between all the territories of the monarchy. The different military formations were actively supported by a powerful diplomatic network among the European countries.<br><br>The aim of the book is to examine the armies and troops of Philip IV and particularly the famous Spanish Tercios deployed in north Europe, Italy and in the Iberian Peninsula. The book covers the organization and development of the Tercios, the tactics used, recruitment and the life of the ordinary soldiers. The development of the Spanish cavalry and its organization is also covered in depth, along with the financing of the army. <br><br>The book also explores the impact of continuous fighting during a period of 44 years to keep the honor and reputation of the Spanish monarchy, as well as their territories intact, and how the army responded to these challenges.</p><p>Pierre Picouet studied Applied Physics at the University of Provence (France), and History at the University of Bordeaux (France).

The Wimpy Kid is back! The misadventures of Greg Heffley, a 6th grade middle school student, continue to be a rip-roaring affair striking the funny bones of young and old alike everywhere. This web-comic-turned-novel, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck (#8) by Jeff Kinney is one of the best in the series. The world has gone crazy for the Wimpy Kid with good reasons. Jeff Kinney is not one of the best children&#39;s writers, but he&#39;s the best inhabiting planet Earth, at least during the time of the release of his latest book. And why say children when it is the adults who are having a good time with the series. The latest in the series has been waited with baited breath not only by children but also by adults as well. Continuing the hilarious saga of Greg Heffley, Jeff Kinney in his inimitable style puts him in an awkward situation when his long-time best friend Rowley Jefferson ditches him. Our hero Greg struggles to find new friend and the book revolves around his quest for a friend without much success, and finally, in his ingenious way, leaves it to luck. There is so much truth in portraying Greg the way it is in the book. Children of Greg&#39;s age think that their parents do not understand them, they always find fault with their older brother, and when it comes to the little brother, there is a feeling of sympathy and kindheartedness. Many children of his age will easily be able to identify with him. Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck is a truth told in a humorous but subtle way. It continues to tickle you with all the issues confronting a middle school student - fame, acceptance, friendship, rivalry, girls and others issues usually associated with students of the same age. What is really interesting about Jeff Kinney&#39;s handling is the depth and humor with which he dealt with issues. To add passion to the story, the book also features cartoon illustrations on each page which is truly a commendable work. Though flaunted as a children&#39;s book, the Wimpy Kid serie</p><p></p><h2>Rivers: A Novel</h2><p><b>In the tradition of Cormac McCarthy, Larry Brown, and James Lee Burke, <i>Rivers</i> is an enthralling, darkly beautiful novel set in Mississippi against the backdrop of a series of devastating storms that pummeled the American South in the years since Hurricane Katrina. </b><br><br><b>It had been raining for weeks.

He had forgotten the last day that it hadn&#x2019;t rained, when the storms gave way to the pale blue of the Gulf sky, when the birds flew and the clouds were white and the sunshine glistened across the drenched land. It rained now, a straight rain, not the diagonal, attacking rain, and it seemed that the last of the gusts had moved on sometime during the night and he wanted to get out. Had to get out of the house, away from the wobbling light of the kerosene lamp, away from the worn deck of cards, away from the paperbacks, away from the radio that hardly ever picked up a signal anymore, away from her voice that he heard in his sleep and heard through the storms and heard whispering from all corners of the short brick house. It rained hard and the early, early morning was black but he had to get out.<br> <br>He stood from the cot and stretched his arms over his head and felt his way across the room in the faint lamplight. He slept in the front room of the house. The same room of the house where he cooked and read and changed clothes and did everything but relieve himself, which he did outside next to where two pines had fallen in a cross. He wore long johns and a sweatshirt and he put on jeans and a flannel shirt over them. When he was dressed, he walked into the kitchen and took a bottle of water from a cooler that sat where the refrigerator used to be and he drank half in one take and then put the bottle back into the cooler. He picked up a flashlight from the kitchen counter and he walked back into the front room and went to a closet in the corner. He shined the light first on the .22 rifle and then on the sawed-off double-barrel shotgun and he chose the shotgun. On the floor was a box of shells and he opened it up and there were only two left and he loaded them.<br> <br>He turned and looked at the dog, curled up on a filthy towel in the corner of the kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t even asking you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The rubber boots were next to the cot and he pulled them on, picked up a sock hat and the heavy-duty raincoat from the floor and put them on, and then he walked to the front door, opened it, and was greeted by the roar of the rain. The cool air rushed on him and the anxiety of the walls inside disappeared into the wet, dark night. He stepped out under the porch and then went around the side of the house, hundreds of tap tap taps on his hood and water to his ankles and the flashlight pointed out in front, the silver streaks racing across the yellow beam.<br> <br>Around the back of the house, Habana whinnied. He opened the door to what had once been a family room and was barely able to avoid the horse as she raced out into the back field. She ran small circles, Cohen holding the light on her and her steps high in the moist land and her neck and head shaking off the rain but her own anxiety being set free in the downpour. He let her be and he stepped inside and took the saddle from the ceramic-tiled floor and once she had run it out, he whistled and she came over to him and he saddled her.<br> <br>With the sawed-off shotgun under his arm, he led the horse down the sloppy driveway to the sloppy road and they rode half a mile west. He rode Habana carefully in the storm, the single beam out before them, but he knew the route. They moved around trees that had fallen years ago and trees that had fallen months ago and trees that had fallen weeks ago. Back off the road, abandoned houses sat quietly, lined by barbed-wire fences brought down by the fallen trees or the wild ivy or both. After an hour or more, they came to the fence row that at one time had been cleared all the way to the sand in order to lay pipe or cable or something that was supposed to help lift them from their knees but that had been abandoned like everything else.<br> <br>The rain came stronger as he turned the horse south and they splashed through the brush and mud. There had once stood an electrical pole every hundred yards but only half of them remained upright and the lines that linked them together had been rolled up onto giant spools and taken away. Habana buckled several times in softer spots but fought on and in a few miles they came to the clearing and there was only ocean in front of them and beach to the east and to the west. He shined the light down on her front legs and they were thick with mud and he told her she did good and he stroked the side of her wet neck. They stood still in the rain and it washed them clean.<br> <br>He turned off the light. Blended with the sound of the storm was the sound of the wash against the shore, the tumble of the whitecaps. A cold wind blew in off the water and he pushed the hood from his head and felt the wind and rain on his face and leaned his head back and felt it around his neck and ears and it was in those moments that he could feel her still there. Still there when there was only the dark and the sounds of what she had loved. He closed his eyes and let the rain soak into him and she was there at the edge of the water, the salty foam rushing around her ankles and her hair across her face and her shoulders red from the sun. He let himself fall back and he lay stretched across the horse, his arms flailing to the sides, the barrel of the shotgun pointing down toward the wet sand and the flashlight dangling from his fingertips. The rhythm of the waves and the crash of the rain and the solitude and the big black world around him and it was in these moments that he felt her there.<br> <br>&#x201c;Elisa,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>He sat back up in the saddle and pulled on his hood. He looked out across the dark ocean and listened and he thought that he heard her. Always thought he heard her no matter how hard the wind blew or how hard the rain fell.<br> <br>He listened, tried to feel her in the push of the waves.<br> <br>Thunder roared out across the Gulf and then far off to the west a string of lightning turned the black to gray for an instant. And the rain came on. Twice what it had been when they left the house. Habana reared her head and snorted the water from her nostrils. The ocean pushed high across what was left of the beach and the thunder bellowed again and Cohen raised the shotgun and fired out into the Gulf as if this world around him were something that could be held at bay by the threat of a bright orange blast. Habana reared with the sound of the shotgun and Cohen dropped the flashlight and got hold of her mane and she leaped forward a little but then steadied. He patted her. Talked to her. Told her, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>When she was still, he got down and felt around for the flashlight, and then he mounted again. He turned the flashlight on, then off, and he turned Habana and they started back.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting worse,&#x201d; he said to Habana, but the words were lost under it all.<br> <br>COHEN STOOD AT THE KITCHEN window with a cup of coffee. The dog, a shaggy black-and-white shepherd-looking thing, stood beside him and chewed beef jerky. Cohen stared at the pile of lumber, switching the coffee cup from hand to hand, trying to bring himself into the day. The morning was a heavy gray and the rain had eased some. Maybe enough for Charlie, he thought. The pile of two-by-fours and two-by-sixes was so wet that he figured he could pick one up and simply fold it end over end. The grass and weeds grew high around the lumber as it had been sitting there for years. He sipped the coffee, looked away from the lumber pile and over to the concrete slab that stretched out from the back of the house. The last frame he had built, months ago, was in a splintered mess in the back field. Almost got to the last wall before another one came and lifted and carried it away. Twice he had gotten two walls done. Twice more he had gotten to the third. He had never gotten to the fourth before it was destroyed.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t going to be a big room. She won&#x2019;t need a big one for a while, Elisa said. Then you can build us a big house with rooms like concert halls. With whose money, he had wanted to know. She shrugged and said we&#x2019;ll worry about that then. So it was going to be an average room, built onto an average house, protected by the same blond brick as the rest of the low-ceilinged ranch-style house. An average room for what they expected to be a much more than average little girl. Her place to sleep, and play, and grow. Four years ago the foundation had been poured, before it was impossible to pour a foundation, before it was impossible to imagine such things as building a room onto your house.<br> <br>Now all it did was rain. Before the storm. During the storm. After the storm. Difficult to tell when one hurricane ended and the next one began.<br> <br>He sipped the coffee and then lit a cigarette.<br> <br>Goshdamn wood will never dry out, he thought. And he had thought and thought of ways to frame a room with wet wood, onto a wet slab, that would stand against hurricane-force winds, but he hadn&#x2019;t made it there yet. Unless God changed His laws, he wasn&#x2019;t going to ever get there. He scratched at his beard. Drank the last of the coffee. Watched out the window and smoked the cigarette. Then he decided to go and see if Charlie was around.<br> <br>He climbed on a chair in the kitchen and moved away a water-stained ceiling tile, reached his hand up into the hole, and took down a cigar box. He opened the box and there was a stack of cash and he took out four hundred-dollar bills and he folded and stuck them in the front pocket of his jeans. After he put the box away and set the ceiling tile back in place, he picked up the radio from the kitchen counter, turned it on, and listened with his ear close to the speaker, the distant voice of a man overrun by clouds of static. He turned it off, and then he walked over to the cot and picked up the raincoat and sock hat and put them on and then he walked over to the closet. He chose the sawed-off shotgun over the .22, kicked at the empty box of shotgun shells, and then made sure the one and only shell was still in the chamber. The dog crossed the room and stood at his side and followed him to the door but stopped there.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave the door open for you,&#x201d; Cohen said and the dog looked up at him, out at the rain, then went back inside.<br> <br>He went out to the Jeep and sat down behind the wheel and set the shotgun on the passenger seat. He had drilled holes in the floorboard to keep the water from puddling, and an overflowing rain gauge was tied to the roll bar. The Jeep cranked and then he drove across the front yard toward the muddy gravel road, leaving tire tracks in the earth.<br> <br>At the end of the road, he turned onto the two-lane highway that connected him to the busted interstate running parallel to the water. The sky was a lighter gray to the west, but far off in the southeast was a gathering of pillow-like clouds. He turned onto the highway and drove along with cold rain against him. At a lower stretch of road, he slowed because of the water and drove on with his eyes far ahead to where the road showed itself again and he aimed for the higher ground, hoping he would remain on the asphalt that he couldn&#x2019;t see beneath the muddy water. He made it through the water and then after several miles he came to a crossroads with an old gas station where he used to buy boiled peanuts from an old man who sat on the tailgate of his truck in the parking lot. Past the crossroads he came to a small community and he slowed and looked at the remaining houses and stores lining the highway, wondered if there were people somewhere back in there, back in the faceless gray buildings that seemed to be disappearing, as if they were slowly flaking away and sinking into the earth. Even so, he felt like somebody was watching him. Always felt like somebody was watching him when he made his way through one of these ghost towns.<br> <br>There was a beautiful sadness to it all that he couldn&#x2019;t explain. It was a sentiment he had tried to ignore, but it had seeped into him and remained, some kind of grave nostalgia for the catastrophes and the way of life that once had been. As a boy he had ridden with his father, and his father would point out the buildings and houses he had framed. Seemed like he had worked on the entire coastline. Gulfport, Biloxi, Ocean Springs, Moss Point. Didn&#x2019;t matter where they were, what road they were on, his father was always pointing and saying put that one up. Put that one up. Worked on that one there. Put that one up. And Cohen sensed the pride in his father&#x2019;s voice. Felt his own pride in his old man and his rough hands and what he did with them. His father seemed magical. During the day erecting houses and buildings along the coast and in the evenings feeding cows and bush-hogging the place and in the night sitting in his chair and sipping a drink and walking outside to smoke and talking to Cohen like he was a little man and not a little boy and Cohen wanting to be like him. He had always believed that one day he would ride around with his own children and then grandchildren and he would point out of the window and say put that one up. Did that one over there. Put that one up. And he had been like his father. He had put some of them up. But there were no children to show them to, and even if there were, what he had put up was now down and all he could say was that&#x2019;s where one used to be. Put one up over there that&#x2019;s gone. Used to be one right over there. Whenever he went out in the Jeep, he looked around at the concrete foundations, at the splintered remains, at the heaps of debris, at the places where his work once stood, and there was sadness, and despair, and awe. And he wondered what his father would say if he had lived to see his work stripped bare. He wondered how his father would feel now to have his work gone. Simply not there. Removed by the wind and the rain. Removed with violence. Removed without prejudice.<br> <br>As if it had never been.</p><h2>Papal Bull: An Ex-Catholic Calls Out the Catholic Church</h2><p>Dr. Joe Wenke, disciple of such brilliant and provocative social critics as Christopher Hitchens, Bill Maher and George Carlin, has taken on the Catholic Church with PAPAL BULL: An Ex-Catholic Calls Out the Catholic Church.

In the fall of 1986, Sahebjam--an Iranian journalist who'd been kidnapped and beaten by pro-Khomeini terrorists in Paris- -sneaked into Iran to investigate conditions. In the isolated village of Kupayeh, an old woman beckoned him aside and told him that, two weeks before, her niece, Soraya M., had been executed by stoning. Here, after Sahebjam sets forth these facts, he tells Soraya's story, based on his interviews with the aunt, the village's mayor, and others: Though a faithful wife and devoted mother, Soraya, 35, was a lonely woman who kept to herself, in part because of her bad marriage to one Ghorban-Ali, a low-life who, aligning himself with Khomeini, had risen to power in the village even as he abused his wife, visited prostitutes, and carried on with a younger woman. Meanwhile, one Hassan Lajevardi, pederast and felon, had murdered a magistrate in a nearby city and fled to Kupayeh, where he took control of the town by posing as a mullah. But despite his clerical garb, Lajevardi made a pass at Soraya, which she rejected. Soon, Ghorban-Ali--who wished his wife gone-- and the incensed Lajevardi began to plot. Roping other villagers into their scheme, they accused Soraya of adultery; as dictated by custom, the men of the village met and voted a sentence: death by stoning. As the villagers circled around her, Soraya was buried up to her shoulders. Her father threw the first stone; more flew until she died. The village women then laid Soraya at a nearby river, where, the following day, her aunt found the body savaged by dogs. She washed and buried the bones, and ``then, and only then, did she pray and burst into tears.'' An unforgettable indictment, brilliantly written and translated, of man's inhumanity to woman--and of tyranny disguised as righteousness. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Two months after its opening in July 1998, Tsunami was voted Best New Restaurant by Memphis magazine. Since that time it has maintained one of the top three spots in the categories of "Best Seafood" and "Most Creative Menu" in Memphis magazine's readers' poll every year. <br>Here Chef Smith has assembled over 150 recipes, displaying his love for "clean, uncluttered presentations" and "crisp, identifiable flavors." Influenced by his culinary experiences from San Francisco to the South Pacific, Chef Smith includes recognizably Pacific Rim-inspired dishes like Sautï¿½ed Mahi-Mahi with Grilled Pineapple Salsa and Cilantro Pesto, Thai Beef Salad, and Lemongrass Ice Cream, new twists on Latin American foods such as Scallop Ceviche and Chilled Avocado Soup, as well as a nod to his Southern roots with innovative recipes like Crawfish Cakes with Black Bean Remoulade. <br>Chef Smith's practical advice and entertaining anecdotes, infused throughout this easy-to-use, elegantly photographed cookbook, give a glimpse into the daily life of this lively restaurateur. His infectious love of fresh and simple, internationally inspired dishes makes this a handy guide for anyone who has ever left their favorite Pacific Rim restaurant wanting to "try it at home."</p><p>Chef Ben Smith was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. He attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York, and worked for Jeremiah Tower at Stars Restaurant from 1986 to 1989. After further experience in culinary jobs from Australia to Hawaii, he returned to Tennessee and opened Tsunami in 1998, introducing innovative, contemporary, Pacific Rim-inspired cuisine to Memphis and the mid-South. He frequently hosts cooking classes at Tsunami and at the Viking Culinary Arts Center in downtown Memphis. <br>Raised in Mississippi, photographer Ben Couvillion graduated from Mississippi State University with a bachelor's degree in fine arts. A graphic designer by trade, it was not until he discovered an old twin-lens camera in a Memphis camera shop that he truly fell in love with photography. He credits Billy Riley, his good friend and former employer, for allowing him the opportunity to pursue his photographic interests. Now residing in Richmond, Virginia, with his wife and son, Mr. Couvillion continues to explore his abilities as a designer and photographer.</p><p>"The recipes are a sort of road map of my travels from Memphis to New York to San Francisco, to Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, New Caledonia, and finally back to Memphis."<br> --Chef Ben Smith</p><p>Chef Smith's philosophy that "a good chef is merely the catalyst" is reflected here in over 150 recipes inspired by the Pacific Rim and elsewhere. Written in the fast-paced, no-nonsense, yet sophisticated voice of a well-traveled culinary artist, The Tsunami Restaurant Cookbook perpetuates the comfortable and outgoing personality of Tsunami, consistently voted one of the top three restaurants in Memphis, Tennessee. <br>Chef Smith's relaxed, unconstrained style demystifies many of the Asian ingredients used in the Tsunami kitchen and serves as an informative reference book for all manners of seafood. Ideal for novices as well as more experienced cooks, The Tsunami Restaurant Cookbook is a refreshing read, practical and enthusiastic, as clean and satisfying as the taste of raw tuna with a splash of soy sauce. <br> Chef Ben Smith was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. He attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York, and worked for Jeremiah Tower at Stars Restaurant from 1986 to 1989. In 1990 he departed on a six-month solo trip through Australia and the South Pacific and worked briefly in Australia as the cook on a one-thousand-acre horse ranch. He worked for three years at the Lodge at Koele in Hawaii before returning to Memphis, where he opened Tsunami in 1998.</p></p><h2>Georgia O&#39;Keeffe: An American Perspective</h2><p>Georgia O'Keeffe was one of the most successful American artists of the twentieth century, and her dramatic and iconic paintings are recognised throughout the world today. <br>In this spectacular giant format book, over 100 reproductions of O'Keeffe's most important work are accompanied by Lauris Morgan-Griffiths' expert and insightful commentary on all aspects of the artist's life, influences and paintings.

With bombs and bullets they started killing in the name of 'peace'. Almost all of them came from prosperous, educated families. They were 'Hitler's children' not only in that they had been born in or immediately after the Nazi period - some of their parents having been members of the Nazi party - but also because they were as fiercely against individual freedom as the Nazis were. Their declared ideology was Communism. They were beneficiaries of both American aid and the West German economic miracle. Despising their immeasurable gifts of prosperity and freedom, they 'identified' themselves with Third World victims of wars, poverty and oppression, whose plight they blamed on 'Western imperialism'. In reality, their terrorist activity was for no better cause than self-expression. </p> <br> <p> Their dreams of leading a revolution were ended when one after another of them died in shoot-outs with the police, or was blown up with his own bomb, or was arrested, tried, and condemned to long terms of imprisonment. All four leaders of the Red Army Faction (dubbed 'the Baader-Meinhof gang' by journalists) committed suicide in prison. </p></p><p>Jillian Becker is the author of several novels and works of nonfiction, including&#34; The PLO&#34; and &#34;Hitler s Children&#34;.

Next, the lights come up on a hospital room where Beth lies, bandaged, aphasic, and confused. Alternating the action between platforms on either side of the stage where Beth's and Jake's families live, Shepard exposes the secrets of sordid pasts of insanity, alcoholism, and alienation. High-school theater students should find a number of short scenes suitable for two-person dialogues. Props and costumes would not be needed for classroom readings. A short radio monologue by Shepard and Joseph Chaikin, The War in Heaven, is included in the last 19 pages of the book. Music notes, a set description, and stage directions accompany the dialogue.

During this time, the United States became a major creditor to other nations, which in turn had a significant impact on power relations between nations. The Commerce Department also became a champion of American economic rights and independence from foreign commodities, and in the process became the guiding force in national economic policy.</p><p>Joseph Brandes is Emeritus Professor of History, William Paterson College of New Jersey.</p><h2>The Deer Stalker: A Western Story</h2><p>Because of the unrestrained slaughter of cougars on Buckskin Mountain, the deer population has increased so fast that they begin to starve. But when Thad Eburne, chief forest ranger, hears the government's plan to open a massive deer hunt to hundreds of indiscriminate hunters, he worries that it will only worsen man's dangerous meddling with nature. Then, when Eburne decides to save a deer herd from a cattleman bent on selling illegal deer meat for easy money, he finds himself up against the deadliest outlaw in the West. In <i>The Deer Stalker</i>, readers will find all they have come to expect from the great Western author Zane Grey&#x2014;swift action, magnificent descriptions of the desert and canyon country, plus the added valiant effort of a ranger's struggle to save the doomed herd of deer on the Buckskin range. Grey makes the reader see this colorful Arizona country, feel something of the awe that is the inevitable reaction of man to the majesty of one of nature's miracles, smell the tang of mingled pine and sagebrush, and thrill to the heroic struggle of a few dedicated men as they battle to undo the harm of the willful and greedy.</p><p><b>Zane Grey</b> was born on January 31, 1872, in Zanesville, Ohio.

You're at the table, everyone's watching, and you're struggling to carve a hot bird. Instead, I decided to make a roasted turkey breast stuffed with all kinds of delicious things--sausage, cranberries, and figs. No bones and it cooks to juicy perfection in under two hours. How easy is that? <p>Sweet potatoes are available year-round, but their prime season is really autumn and winter. Choose potatoes that are smooth and unblemished, and use them fairly soon because they don't keep as well as other potatoes. These potatoes are crispy like fries but they're better for you because they're baked. <em>--Ina Garten</em></p> <p><i>(Photo credit Quentin Bacon)</i></p> <strong>Roasted Turkey Roulade</strong><br> (Serves 6 or 7)<br> <p></p><br> 3/4 cup large-diced dried figs, stems removed<br> 3/4 cup dried cranberries<br> 1/2 cup Calvados or brandy<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter<br> 1-1/2 cups diced onions (2 onions)<br> 1 cup (1/2-inch-diced) celery (3 stalks)<br> 3/4 pound pork sausage, casings removed (sweet and hot mixed)<br> 1-1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves<br> 3 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted<br> 3 cups Pepperidge Farm herb-seasoned stuffing mix<br> 1-1/2 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade <br> 1 extra-large egg, beaten<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 whole (2 halves) turkey breast, boned and butterflied (5 pounds)<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> <p>Place the dried figs and cranberries in a small saucepan and pour in the Calvados and 1/2 cup water.

Spread the stuffing in a 1/2-inch-thick layer over the meat, leaving a half-inch border on all sides. Don&#x2019;t mound the stuffing or the turkey will be difficult to roll. (Place the leftover stuffing in a buttered gratin dish and bake for the last 45 minutes of roasting alongside the turkey.) Starting at one end, roll the turkey like a jelly roll and tuck in any stuffing that tries to escape on the sides.

Filled with dreamy optimism and a love for the unspoken promises of the night sky, David tries to find his way in a narrow, unforgiving, and controlled world. His conflicts are both internal and external, locking him in an unceasing struggle for survival; sometimes the sea is his enemy, sometimes his own rude behavior, sometimes his best friend Gershom Born, sometimes his secret love for the island teacher Mary Dauphiny; but always, inevitably, his Jung relatives and their manifold ambitions for money and power.</p><p>The balance of life on Rockbound is precarious and thus fiercely guarded by all who inhabit its lonely domain, but just as a sudden change in the direction of the wind can lead to certain peril at sea, so too can the sudden change in the direction of a man's heart lead to a danger altogether unknown.</p><p>Enormously evocative of the power, terror, and dramatic beauty of the Atlantic sea, and unrelenting in its portrait of back-breaking labour, cunning bitterness, and family strife, Rockbound is a story of many passions-love, pride, greed, and yearning -- all formed and buffeted on a small island by an unyielding wind and the rocky landscape of the human spirit.</p><p><b>Canada Reads 2005 Winner!</b></p><p>In a David and Goliath style battle to the finish, <i>Rockbound</i> by Frank Parker Day triumphed over <i>Oryx and Crake</i> by Margaret Atwood and was declared the 2005 Canada Reads winner.

Battling the unpredictable sea and steering his way between Rockbound's two warring clans, the friendless orphan gradually builds a life for himself. He marries and has a son, finds a soulmate in lighthouse keeper Gershom Born, and falls deeply (and secretly) in love with Mary, the island schoolteacher. But he does not reckon on the wicked cunning of his great-uncle, Uriah, self-proclaimed king of Rockbound and David's one true enemy.</p> <p>First published in 1928, Frank Parker Day's deeply allusive novel evokes the terrifying power and breathtaking beauty of Canada's Atlantic coastline, where a shift in the wind &#x2014; like a sudden change in a man's heart &#x2014; can lead to certain peril.

Its fourteen-year-old heroine, Wendla, is killed by abortion pills. The young Moritz, terrorized by the world around him, and especially by his teachers, shoots himself. The ending seems likely to be the suicide of Moritz&#39;s friend, Melchior, but in a confrontation with a mysterious stranger (the famous Masked Man) he finally manages to shed his illusions and face the consequences.<b>Frank Wedekind</b> (1864-1918) was born in Hanover.

These spare and unsentimental stories display how two very different people -- a tough-minded and tenderhearted woman and an urbane, old-fashioned older man -- fall in love despite their differences, get married, and give birth to a child.</p><p><p>Laurie Colwin is the author of five novels: <em>Happy All the Time</em>; <em>Family Happiness</em>; <em>Goodbye Without Leaving</em>; <em>Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object</em>; and <em>A Big Storm Knocked It Over</em>; three collections of short stories: <em>Passion and Affect</em>, <em>Another Marvelous Thing</em>, and <em>The Lone Pilgrim</em>; and two collections of essays: <em>Home Cooking</em> and <em>More Home Cooking</em>. She died in 1992.</p>In her deceptively simple, witty style, Colwin (Happy All the Time, Family Happiness continues to write with perception about the bliss and pain of people in love. Her protagonists in these eight linked stories are Josephine (Billy) Delielle and Francis Clemens, both intelligent achievers happily married to their respective spouses, who fall into an unlikely but tender affair when they meet in the offices of the highbrow journal to which they both contribute articles on economics. Billy is young, sloppy, often grumpy, unsentimental, determinedly minimalist in her tastes in food and clothing. Francis is older, sophisticated, urbane, committed to neatness and routine. The stories depict some of the same events told from their differing points of view; despite passion and familiarity, each discovers the essential unknowableness of the other. Both know the relationship will have to end, but the ache of parting is ameliorated for Billy by the consolidation of her marriage through the birth of a baby. Billy and Francis are somewhat improbable as lovers, and Colwin studs the text with too many pithy apothegms about the indelible effects of a love affair, but there are many moments in this slim volume when the reader is touched and moved.

Over 1,000 color photos. Index.</p><p>Roger Phillips is an award-winning photographer with a reputation spanning thirty years. He has consistently pioneered the use of colour photography for the reliable identification of natural history subjects, and has wrtten more than 20 books dedicated to this purpose.If a gardener needs a single visual guide to the vegetable kingdom, this may be the one. Generously illustrated with color photographs that regard both the larger landscape and the root tendrils on a turnip with a serious eye, the book documents more than 650 types of vegetable, mainly those that can be grown in North America and northern Europe, but also takes stock of Asian specialties currently in demand. Search out parsnips, for example, and you'll find the pale, soggy-looking specimens of five different kinds lined up, as if for mug shots; a glimpse of parsnips au naturel --in the ground, not the studio--is also on hand, as is a brief note on the parsnip's history and its cultivational needs. Extensive, equally explicit spreads on more popular vegetables abound, whether the culprit is spinach or the humble broad bean (shown both with pods zipped shut and split open, seeds intact inside). Though not mainly a source of gardener's tips, the book offers simple instructions to the grower, as well as fodder for anyone curious to know more about the first European sighting of potatoes (1537) or the multitudes of possible potatoes ("Duke of York"; "Epicure"; "Mona Lisa"). <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Life of Jesus</h2><p>This exquisitely beautiful book by Mary Billingsley presents the rosary for children, but I might add &#x2013; for children of all ages. When I first saw a few of the paintings, I wondered if it was wise to portray Christ, Our Lady, and the other participants in the drama of the rosary as puppet or manikin figures. But the idea very much grew on me and, as I now see the final outcome of Mary&#x2019;s work, I&#x2019;m completely captivated. This is a rosary book for young and old.</p><p>Mary Billingsley creates art with paint, collage, pencil,and fabric, and has exhibited her work throughout NewEngland, Pennsylvania, and New York. Visit her website atwww.marybillingsley.com.<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> "Artist and children's book newcomer Billingsley provides an introduction to the rosary in an accessible volume. Outlining the basic procedure for praying the rosary, an opening illustration depicts a set of beads labeled to indicate which prayer each represents; the full text of each prayer appears on the facing page. Billingsley offers brief, plainspoken meditations for each of the 20 mysteries (Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious, and the recently added Luminous); her Scripture-inspired words appear between the names of the prayers, forming a sort of vertical, visual chain of text on each page. Billingsley's folk art&#x2013;style illustrations are two-dimensional renderings of multimedia, still-life structures she has created from found objects (nutcrackers, wooden artists' figures, and rag dolls make appearances). The artwork alternately recalls altars, shrines, or marionette stages, and focuses on such events as the Nativity, the Marriage at Cana, and the Crucifixion. Billingsley's text and art create a surprising and enlightening modern juxtaposition to this very traditional practice."&nbsp;<b><i>CBA Retailers + Resources</i></b><br> "Eerdmans Books for Young Readers brings the rosary to life through lovely illustrations and its sequential prayers following Jesus' life for children, and for adults for that matter, in&nbsp;<i>The Life of Jesus: An Illustrated Rosary</i>."&nbsp;<b><i>School Library Journal</i></b><br> "Billingsley has divided this book according to the four 'Mysteries' that are emblematic of Christ's life &#x2014; 'Joyful,' 'Luminous,' 'Sorrowful,' and 'Glorious,' and then into subsections about each of its five parts. The book is remarkable in the accessibility it offers to readers of all ages. The introductory page provides visual instruction &#x2014; a painting of a rosary with labels and arrows indicating which beads are meant for each prayer &#x2014; followed by the prayers themselves. Each Mystery is presented on a full page with a short narrative centered on white space, followed below by the name of the next recited prayer in italics. This flows to the next narrative piece and the prayer that follows it. The language is especially chosen to clarify biblical verbiage often misconstrued by children. Each left-hand facing page shows a full-color illustration of the Mystery. Billingsley's unusual technique is what stands out; she has created 'shrines' of everyday objects, flowers, puppets, children's toys arranged in a vignette, and then reproduced them in gouache. The overall effect is child-friendly but also intensely emotionally evocative. Other rosary guides for children are useful and come in more 'pew friendly' formats; this book adds elements that enhance the meditative and contemplative demands of the rosary devotion."</p><h2>The Awesome Egyptians (Horrible Histories)</h2><p>Introduces aspects of everyday life in ancient Egypt, explaining the gory details of how mummies were prepared and the basics of Egyptian arithmetic</p><p>Terry Deary has written over 200 books that are available in 40 languages.

Longing for a freedom of the soul that the world of capitalism cannot provide, Lazarus leaves all that he knows--including his wife and children--to achieve the ultimate level of peace and silence living as a homeless man. When his quest causes him to cross paths with four other wanderers, all of whom later call themselves "the family," a shocking, brutal act leaves Lazarus in a dire position and his newfound family must struggle to save him. By doing so, both families--past and present--are redeemed and consequently learn the beauty of sacrificial love.</p><p>DANIEL BLACK was raised in Blackwell, Arkansas and now teaches at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia. He earned the Ph.D. in African American Studies from Temple University then returned to Clark Atlanta as a professor with hopes of inspiring young black minds to believe in themselves.

More than that, he asks what homelessness is like for the five vibrantly original members of his central cast, offering a story not only about the specific circumstances that led them to the streets but, as one of them puts it, about the American imagination and whether they can live there." <b>- </b>Kevin Brockmeier, author of <i>A Few Seconds of Radiant Filmstrip </i>and <i>The Brief History of the Dead</i></p><p>&#x201c;<b><i>The Coming</i></b> is powerful.

Young Laszlo Dracula, second son of a deceased Hungarian nobleman, dreams of devoting his life to the scientific study of the human mind. Sent to Paris in 1866 to become a doctor, 23-year- old Laszlo assists by day at the infamous Salp&#x2c6;tri&#x160;re Hospital while socializing by night with the wealthy friends of his cousin, Nichole. Sinister but clever man-about-town Lothar von Pick soon takes it upon himself to introduce Laszlo to a top tailor and a gentlemen's brothel--where he is deflowered by an unbalanced young woman he tends at the sanitarium. Repelled by his unethical behavior yet unable to restrain himself, Laszlo makes a mistress of this vulnerable patient, until a fit of jealousy causes him to ``accidentally'' cut her throat and flee Paris to avoid a murder charge. Back in the castle, Laszlo discovers that his older brother has died; he assumes the count's title, responsibilities, and even his wife. A 20-year period of isolation and sexual abstinence follows, until Laszlo again feels the beast within him begin to emerge. Soon, another mistress is murdered in a fit of jealousy, a prostitute is killed during a late-night drinking binge, and, finally, the local village maidens begin disappearing one by one. Rumors of vampires fly through the town as each corpse is found more viciously ravished than the one before--and as Count Dracula, now middle-aged and fully aware of the doom that awaits him, hurtles ever-faster down the slope of sin and degradation. Anscombe's characters are richly drawn, and his pseudo- Victorian prose is a pleasure to read--though once we understand where poor Laszlo is headed, the suspense inevitably begins to falter.

Following the events of the story "The City of Skulls," the mighty Cimmerian, as a reward for his services to the king's daughter Zosara, is given a noncommissioned rank corresponding to that of sergeant. In this capacity he goes to the Khozgari Hills as part of the military escort of an emissary sent by the king to the restless tribesmen of that region, in hope of dissuading them by bribes and threats from raiding and plundering the Turanians of the lowlands. But the Khozgarians are warlike barbarians who respect only immediate and overwhelming force. They treacherously attack the detachment, killing the emissary and all but two of the soldiers. These two, Conan andjamal, escape</i>.<br>* * *<br>The lean Turanian, whose dusty crimson jerkin and stained white breeches testified to the rigors of his flight, reined in his mare at the signal. Turning questing black eyes upon his giant leader, he asked:<br>"Dare we tarry here?"<br>His companion, similarly garbed, save that the flowing left sleeve of his woolen shirt bore the golden scimitar of a sergeant in the Turanian frontier cavalry, scowled. Blue eyes blazing beneath the crimson turban that bound his spired helmet, he tossed aside the flap of cloth that protected his face from the swirling dust and spat before he answered.<br>"The beasts must rest."<br>The heaving flanks of the two animals and their foam-flecked mouths made plain the need for a halt.<br>"But, Conan," protested the Turanian, "what if those Khozgari devils still follow us?" Uneasily he studied the curved scimitar thrust into his sash, and his grip tightened on the lance resting in its leathern pouch beside his right stirrup. He was comforted by the weight of the double-curved bow and the full quiver of arrows slung upon his back.<br>"Damn that stupid emissary!" growled the Cimmerian. "Jamal, thrice I warned him of the treacherous Khozgari tribesmen; but his head was so full of trade treaties and caravan routes that he would not listen. Now that thick-skulled head of his hangs in the smokeroom of a chief's hut, along with seven of our company. Damn him to Hell, and damn the lieutenant for permitting the palaver in the rock village!"<br>"Aye, Conan, but what could our lieutenant do? The emissary had full power to command. Our task was to protect him and obey him, only. Had he countered the emissary's orders, the captain would have snapped his scimitar before the regiment and reduced him to the ranks. You know the captain's temper."<br>"Better broken to the ranks than dead," growled Conan, scowling. "We two were lucky to escape when the devils rushed us! Listen!" He held up his hand. "What was that?"<br>Conan rose in his stirrups, blue eyes sweeping the gorges and crevices for the source of the faint sound he had heard. As his companion silently unslung his great bow and nocked an arrow, Conan's hand closed on the hilt of his scimitar.<br>A moment later, he flung himself from the saddle and, like a charging bull, rushed toward the nearby rock wall; for in that fleeting space of time, a youth had raced across the narrow gorge and scaled the steep cliff with the agility of a monkey.<br>Conan swept to the granite wall, found purchase for reaching hands and feet, and clambered upward with the assurance born of long experience. He heaved himself over the rim of the rock and cast himself aside just as a club descended on the spot where, a moment earlier, his head had been. Rolling to his knees, he rose and gripped the arms of his assailant before another blow could fall. Then he stared.<br>It was a girl he held, dirty and disheveled but nevertheless a girl, and her body would have graced the statues of a king's sculptor. Her face was pretty even through the grime, although she was sobbing now in impotent rage as she twisted her slim arms savagely against the fierce grip of her captor.<br>Conan's voice was rough with suspicion. "You are a spy! What tribe?"<br>The girl's emerald eyes flamed as she hurled back her defiance:<br>"I am Shanya, daughter of Shaf Karaz, chief of the Khozgari and ruler of the mountains! He will spit you on his lance and roast you over his council fire for daring to lay hands on me!"<br>"A likely story!" taunted the Cimmerian. "A chiefs daughter without an armed following, here, alone?"<br>"No one dares lay violent hands on Shanya. The Theggir and the Ghoufags cower in their huts as Shanya, daughter of Shaf Karaz, rides abroad to hunt the mountain goat. Dog of a Turanian! Let me loose!"<br>She twisted angrily, but Conan held her slim body in the vise of his arms.<br>"Not so fast, my pretty one! You'll make a fine hostage for our safe passage back to Samara. You will ride before me on the saddle all the way; and you'd best sit still, lest you make the journey bound and gagged." He grinned in cold indifference to her hot temper.<br>"Dog!" she cried. "I do as you say for the present. But have a care that you fall not into the hands of the Khozgari in the future!"<br>"We were surrounded by your tribesmen a scant two hours past," growled Conan. "But their bowmen could not hit the wall of a canyon. Jamal here could outshoot a dozen of them. Enough of this chatter! We move, and move fast. Keep your pretty mouth shut from now on; it is easy enough to gag."<br>The girl's lips curled with unspoken ire as the horses picked their careful way between the rocks and boulders.<br>"Which way do you plan to go, Conan?" Jamal's voice was anxious.<br>"We cannot go back. I don't trust this hostage business too much in the heat of ambush. We will ride straight south to the road of Garma and cross the Misty Mountains through the Bhambar Pass. That should put us within two days' journey of Samara."<br>The girl turned to stare at him, her face blanched with sudden fright.<br>"You fool! Are you so careless of life as to try to cross the Misty Mountains? They are the haunts of the People of the Summit. No traveler has ever entered their land and returned. The People emerged but once out of the mists during the reign of Angharzeb of Turan, and they defeated his whole army by magic and monsters, as the king strove to recover the burial grounds of the ancient Turanians. 'Tis a land of terror and death! Do not go there!"<br>Conan's reply was indifferent. "Everywhere there are old wives' tales of demons and monsters that no one living has ever seen. This is the safest and shortest way. If we make a detour, we shall have to spend a week in the guardhouse for dallying along the road." He urged his horse forward. The clatter of hooves on stone alone broke the silence as they wove their way among the towering cliffs.<br>* * *<br>This blasted fog is as thick as mare's milk!" exclaimed Jamal some time later.<br>The mist hung dank and impenetrable; the travelers could see a scant two yards ahead. The horses walked slowly, side by side, occasionally touching, feeling their way forward with careful steps. The thickness of the milky mist was inconstant; the whiteness wavered and billowed, and now and then the bleak walls of the mountain pass appeared for a fleeting moment.<br>Conan's senses were sharply tuned. One hand held the bared scimitar; the other clutched Shanya firmly. His eyes ranged the small field of vision, taking advantage of every opening to reconnoiter.<br>The girl's scream, ringing out with sudden shock, brought them to a halt. She pointed with a trembling finger, cowering in the saddle against Conan's massive chest.<br>"I saw something move! Just for a second! It was not human!"<br>Conan swept the scene with narrowed lids as a random billowing of the mist cleared the roadway in front for a moment. He stiffened in the saddle, then relaxed and urged the horses forward, saying:<br>"Naught for the daughter of a Khozgari chief to worry about!"<br>But the shape at the roadside was disturbing. A human skeleton danced from two poles, crossed slantwise. The bones were held together by some fluttering rags, bits of tendon, and shriveled skin. The skull lay on the ground, grinning, snapped from the neckbones and cracked open like a coconut.<br>A sound floated through the mists. It began as a demonic laugh that rose and fell, changing into angry chattering, and ending in an ululating wail. The girl responded with keening. Stiff with terror, her lips moved dryly.<br>"The--the demons of the Summit are calling for our flesh! Our bones will lie stripped in their stone dwelling before evening. Oh, save me! I do not want to die!"<br>Conan felt the hair rise on the nape of his neck; and chills ran down his spine on little lizard feet. But he shook off his fear of the unknown with a shrug of his great shoulders.<br>"We are here, and we have to get through. Let that howler come within reach of my blade, and he'll scream in another key."<br>As his horse stepped forward, a heavy crash and a groan caused Conan to glance back. At that moment, he felt a tug upon his weeping captive. Before he could grasp her more firmly, she rose screaming into the mists on the end of a snakelike rope. Conan's horse reared wildly, flinging him to the ground, and the clatter of its hooves died away as he staggered to his feet.<br>Nearby lay Jamal and his horse, both crushed beneath a giant boulder. The man's dead hand protruded from under the gray stone, still clutching the war bow and a quiver of arrows. These Conan scooped up in one swift motion. He wasted no time in mourning the death of his comrade; for here was deadly danger. Snarling like an angry panther, he slung the bow over his shoulder, stuck the arrows in his sash, and gripped his bared scimitar.<br>The thick mist swirled around him as he felt a noose drop over his head. Moving with the speed of lightning, he ducked, then seized the rope with his free hand, gave a tug, and voiced a gurgling cry like that of a strangling man. His eyes were slitted as he swung upward, hauled by an immense power whose source he knew not. The feel of the mist was wet in his nostrils.<br>Heavy hands gripped him as he reached the edge of the escarpment, but the figures he discerned in the thinning mist were shadows only. He shrugged free of the clutching fingers and drove in silent deadliness at the nearest shadow. Soft resistance and a shriek told him that his scimitar had entered living flesh. Then the shadows closed around him. Standing with his back to the edge of the abyss, he swung his great blade in devastating arcs.<br>Never had Conan battled in such eerie surroundings. His enemies disappeared into the misty whirls, only to return again and again, like insubstantial ghosts. Their blades flicked out like serpents' tongues, but he soon took the measure of their clumsy swordsmanship. With renewed self-confidence, he taunted his silent attackers.<br>"Time you learned something of the way of the sword, you jackals of the mist! Ambushing travelers does not make for skill with the scimitar. You need lessons. The undercut--like this! The overhand slash-there! The upward rip with the point into the throat--watch!"<br>His exclamations were accompanied by demonstrations that left many shadowy figures gurgling or shrieking on the rocks. The Cimmerian fought with cold and terrible control, and suddenly he carried the fight to his assailants in a swift and devastating charge. Two more figures fell to his vicious slashes, their crimson guts spilling out upon the moss. Suddenly the remaining foemen melted away in panicky flight.<br>Conan wiped the sweat off his forehead with the wide sleeve of his uniform. Then, bending down to stare at one of the corpses, he grunted in surprise. It was no human being that sprawled there with small, sightless eyes and flaring nostrils. The low forehead and receding jaw were those of an ape, but an ape unlike any he had seen in the forests on the shores of the Sea of Vilayet. This ape was hairless from head to toe, and its only accouterment was a heavy rope twisted around its bulging swagbelly.<br>Conan was puzzled. The great Vilayet apes never hunted in packs and lacked the intelligence to use arms and tools, save when trained for performances before the royal court in Aghrapur. Nor was the creature's sword of a crude design. Forged of the best Turanian steel, its curved blade was honed to a razor's edge. Conan noticed a penetrating, musky odor emanating from the dead ape. His nostrils widened as he inhaled the scent with care. He would smell out his escaped prey and, following its trail, win a path through the milky mist.<br>"I shall have to save that fool of a girl," he muttered in an undertone. "She may be the daughter of an enemy, but I will not leave a woman in the hands of hairless apes." Like a hunting leopard, he moved forward on the scent.<br>As the mists began to thin, he trod more carefully. The spoor of the scent twisted and turned, as if panic had wrought havoc with his quarry's sense of direction. Conan smiled grimly. Better to be the hunter than the hunted.<br>Here and there beside the path small pyramids of spherical stones the size of a man's head rose above the low-lying mists. These, Conan knew, were ancient places of the dead, graves of the chiefs of the early Turanian tribes. Neither time nor the apes had managed to demolish them. The Cimmerian stepped carefully around each grave, not only to avoid a possible ambush, but also to show reverence for those who rested there.<br>Only torn shreds of mist remained as he reached the upper heights. Here the path became a narrow walkway atop a mountain wall, which bisected a dizzying abyss. At the end of the walkway, at the very summit of the mountain, an imposing keep of mottled serpentine loomed like an index finger of evil against the backdrop of bleak and distant mountain ranges. Conan hid behind one of the graves along the path to spy out the situation. But he saw no sign of life.<br>* * *<br>Shanya woke in odd surroundings. She lay upon a divan draped in a rough black cloth. No fetters bound her, but she had been deprived of all her clothing. She stretched her supple body upon this strange bed to look around and recoiled from what she saw.<br>In a wooden armchair, curiously carved, sat a man, but he was like no man that she had ever seen. His ashen face seemed made of chalk and strangely stiff; his eyes were black with no white showing around the iris; his head was bald. He wore a kaftan of coarse black cloth and hid his hands within the ebon sleeves.<br>"It has been many long years since a beautiful woman last came to the abode of Shangara," he said in a sibilant whisper. "No new blood has infused the race of the People of the Summit for twice a hundred years. You are a fit mate for me and for my son."<br>Horror ignited a bright flame of anger in the breast of the proud barbarian girl.<br>"Think you that a daughter of a hundred chiefs would mate with one of your abominable race? Rather would I fling myself into the nearest gorge than dwell within your house! Release me, or these walls will tremble to the thunder of a thousand Khozgari spears!"<br>A mocking smile parted the pale lips of the ancient, pallid face.<br>"You are a headstrong hussy! No spears reach through the Bhambar mists. No mortal lives who dares to cross these mountains. Come to your senses, girl! Should you persist in stubbornness, no easy leap from a cliff's edge will be your fate. Your body will, instead, be used to nourish the most ancient inhabitant of this forgotten land--one who is bound in serfdom to the People of the Summit.<br>"He it was who helped smite down the Turanian king who once endeavored to conquer our domain.

Boice also comments in the introduction, "Is the Book of Matthew relevant today? It certainly is. In a largely secular age, as ours is, we need to know that Jesus is truly God's King. In a day of nominal Christianity, we need to hear Christ's call to 'follow me.'

It will inform and help a wide range of readers--from serious Bible students to interested laypersons--understand and apply the truths found in the text. <br> Both volumes deal with Matthew's emphasis on Jesus as the Messiah or King of Israel.

Students of military history have long recognized the importance of Kursk, also known as &#34;Operation Citadel,&#34; and there have been several serious studies of the battle. Yet, the German view of the battle has been largely ignored.After the war, U.S. Army Intelligence officers gathered German commanders&#39; post-war reports of the battle. Due, in part, to poor translations done after the war, these important documents have been overlooked by World War II historians. Steven H. Newton has collected, translated, and edited these accounts, including reports made by the Chiefs of Staff of Army Group South and the Fourth Panzer Army, and by the Army Group Center Operations Officer. As a result, a new and unprecedented picture of German strategy and operations is made available. The translated staff reports are supplemented by Newton&#39;s commentary and original research, which challenges a number of widely accepted ideas about this pivotal battle.</p><p>Steven H. Newton is Professor of History at Delaware State University. His previous books on World War II include Kursk: The German View and Retreat from Leningrad.This compilation of German material on the Battle of Kursk (1943) is about as user-friendly as a Tiger tank, but just as indispensable in the right place. Newton has assembled a variety of primary source material from high-ranking German participants either not previously available in English or found only in translations of dubious value. The first part of the book goes to a new translation of a study of Operation Citadel (the great tank battle of Kursk) edited by General Theodor Busse, which offers the perspectives of key tank, infantry, and air commanders. The rest is devoted to essays, mostly by corps commanders facing the Soviet offensive that followed the German defeat at Kursk, but with one perceptive set of comments by a senior railroad officer who throws light on the role (and limitations) of the Soviet partisans in the general logistical nightmare that was the Eastern Front. Both the introduction and the conclusionary third section, which Newton pens, add insightful editorial comments with a tendency to debunk the German myths of "we almost won," and support the characterization of Kursk as a battle the Germans should not have fought because they could not have won it at an acceptable cost. Largely inaccessible to the beginning student of the decisive campaign of World War II, the book may be hailed as invaluable by the serious one. 4 maps and 20 b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Coyote and the Grasshoppers: A Pomo Legend (Native American Legends)</h2><p>By listening to the Great Spirit and eating huge quantities of grasshoppers, Coyote is able to save the Pomo from drought and starvation.</p><p><p>Gr 3-6-Each tape features a story from a Native American tribe, a brief account of the tribe's culture and history, and a glossary of terms.

Founded in 1834 on the high plains of present-day eastern Wyoming, the fort evolved into an organizational hub and chief supply center for the U.S. Army in its campaigns against the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians.<p><i>Fort Laramie in 1876</i> focuses on a crucial year in the history of the fort, a year that saw General George Crook's Big Horn, Yellowstone, and Powder River expeditions; the defeat of Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer at the Little Big Horn; a fevered rush to the Black Hills gold fields; and chaos at the Red Cloud and Spotted Tail Indian agencies. Many historians have written about these events, but Paul L. Hedren is the first to dwell on the operations of the most important military post on the northern plains during that time. He has drawn on the official army records of Fort Laramie&#x2014;a vast body of correspondence, orders, and directives from all command levels&#x2014;in addition to diaries and journals. Collectively, they illuminate the scene of a frontier military outpost making history in its support of General Crook in the Great Sioux War.</p></p><p>Paul L.

King Satha of Cambodia and his retainers were beating a path through the undergrowth when they were halted by stone giants, and then a massive wall. The King, the fable reported, ordered 6,000 men to bring down the wall, thereby exposing the city of Angkor - &#39;lost&#39; for over a century. Subsequent reports from Portuguese missionaries described its four gateways, with bridges flanked by stone figures leading across a moat. There were idols covered in gold, inscriptions, fountains, canals, and &#39;a temple with five towers, called Angor [sic]&#39;. For four centuries, this huge complex has inspired awe amongst visitors from all over the world, but only now are its origins and history becoming clear. This book begins with the progress of the prehistoric communities of the area and draws on the author&#39;s recent excavations to portray the rich and expansive chiefdoms that existed at the dawn of civilization. It covers the origins of early states, up to the establishment, zenith and decline of this extraordinary civilization, whose most impressive achievement was the construction of the gilded temple mausoleum of Angkor Wat, in the twelfth century, allegedly by 70,000 people.</p><p>"<i>The Civilization of Angkor</i> is remarkable and unique in that it delves into the prehistoric roots of the civilization.

Eberle seeks to rediscover a renewed sense of meaning in life through looking for ways to enter the realm of sacred time or "sabbath time"&#x2014;where we can reconnect with the slower, deeper rhythms of life that have traditionally been experienced through worship, prayer, and the observance of holy days. <br><br>Drawing from the work of Western philosophers from Aristotle to Heidegger, and on theorists from Jung to Foucault, he presents both an intellectual history of time and a personal account of his own search for sacred time. Along the way he formulates an insightful analysis of our culture's obsession with speed and efficiency, and he offers guidance for slowing down to savor life outside of schedules and routines, showing the way toward finding fulfillment in this increasingly accelerated world.</p><p>This book is the culmination of a long personal search for the meaning of sacred time in the modern world. I invite the reader to join me in the spirit of an interesting walk or desultory after-dinner conversation or any other of the &#34;sacred&#34; activities that enrich our lives but that we don&#39;t often take time for in our over-busy world.

How old is language? How do we all know how to speak so effortlessly? Why is structural grammatical language specifically human?

He does for language what David Attenborough does for animals&#39; John Gribbin, the &#34;Sunday Times&#34;.</p><p><p>In this classic, the world's expert on language and mind lucidly explains everything you always wanted to know about language: how it works, how children learn it, how it changes, how the brain computes it, and how it evolved. With deft use of examples of humor and wordplay, Steven Pinker weaves our vast knowledge of language into a compelling story: language is a human instinct, wired into our brains by evolution. <em>The Language Instinct</em> received the William James Book Prize from the American Psychological Association and the Public Interest Award from the Linguistics Society of America.

Martin takes viewers through the seasons in his Devon, England, forest garden and shows them how to plan their planting to mimic the layering, density, and diversity of a forest.</p> <p>A wide variety of edible plants can be grown, for example: Nepalese raspberry and Siberian purslane, Turkish rocket and Good King Henry, lime trees (their leaves make a good salad), bamboo (young shoots are tasty when steamed), snowbell trees for their fruit, and the berries of mulberry or chokeberry.</p> <p><em>A Forest Garden Year</em> offers tips on how to graft an apple tree from which you can crop a variety of apples over several months; how to grow shiitake mushrooms and perennial leeks; how to pollard and prune; protect crops from wind; attract beneficial insects; and increase beneficial minerals in the soil-all while creating a haven for yourself and for wildlife.<br></p></p><p><p>&#x201c;Martin is a true pioneer and his work deserves respect and celebration.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Permaculture Magazine </i></p><br><br><p>"Martin Crawford is a frontiersman, a pioneering teacher, and an inspiration.

Prescott avoided the dry, names-and-dates style of standard histories and instead brought the past alive, telling with drama and vigor the stories of the men who came face to face with the unknown, and the numerous brushes with death they survived as they carved out an empire in the New World.<br><br><i>History of the Conquest of Mexico &amp; History of the Conquest of Peru</i> unites in one volume for the first time two of Prescott's best known and most powerful works. The books detail with accuracy and emotional resonance the arrival of Spain's conquerors to Mexico and Peru, and the wars of conquest whose outcomes remain the cause of contention even in the present day. <br><br><i>The History of the Conquest of Mexico</i> focuses on Hernan Cortï¿½s, a notary from Spain's Extremadura region, arriving at the edge of the Aztec empire with 500 men, determined to spread Christianity and enlarge the domain of Charles V of Spain. Within the space of a few years Cortï¿½s found himself fending off rivals from Spain and warring against enraged Aztecs, against whose superior numbers Cortï¿½s struggled against the odds to maintain his garrisons. Prescott's biographer Harry Thurston Peck called <i>The History of the Conquest of Mexico</i> "one of the most brilliant examples which the English language possesses of literary art applied to historical narration."<br><br>Conquistadors Pizarro and Almagro are the protagonists of <i>The History of the Conquest of Peru</i>. Prescott tells of their brutal overthrow of the Incas, and the wars between the two of them afterward. Another of Prescott's biographers, Donald G. Darnell, called the book, "an immensely readable history."<br><br>Using a wealth of documentation as raw material, Prescott turned this blend of viewpoints into a heroic and tragic epic of Spain's efforts to dominate Central and South America. <br><br>The Histories</p><p>William Hickling Prescott (1796-1859) ranks with Francis Parkman and Edward Gibbon as one of the greatest historians of the 19th century. Despite eye problems that led to eventual blindness, Prescott wrote many widely praised works of history including The History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella and The History of Phillip II.[<i>History of the Conquest of Mexico</i>] is as much a triumph over the genre as it is a saga of religious imperialism, Hernï¿½n Cortï¿½s' harsh victory over the Aztec nation. (Neil Baldwin <i>Los Angeles Times</i>)</p><h2>Classic Light Aircraft: An Illustrated Look, 1920s to the Present</h2><p>A visual celebration of the wide and colorful variety of the world&#x2019;s light aircraft, old and new, organized from A to Z by manufacturer, this book illustrates more than 800 light aircraft types that are likely to be seen when visiting smaller airports and airfields across the globe. The text explains how each type relates to other models from the same manufacturer and describes the differences between sub-variants, giving the numbers built. For some types, an indication is also given as to how many are currently active. The aircraft fall into the following categories: mass production aircraft built in the thousands by major manufacturers such as Beechcraft, Cessna, De Havilland, and Piper; lesser-known but important production and homebuilt aircraft, typically built in reasonable numbers and likely to be seen at the local airfield; and finally, a selection of older aircraft that continue to be flown and cherished.</p><p>Ron Smith is a British aeronautical engineer, pilot, author, photographer, and historian. He was Head of Future Projects at Westland Helicopters Ltd. and has recently retired from BAE Systems. He has owned a number of light aircraft.This attractive book is described appropriately as a visual celebration of the variety of the worlds light aircraft. This book is, maybe, a starting point for potential builders or owners to help broaden their horizon and identify what appeals, before seeking more detailed sources for essential data. In parallel with builders and owners, there exists a very large train of enthusiasts who simply enjoy viewing and watching. Above all this is a book for all who take pleasure in the lighter and gentler side of powered, fixed-wing aviation.! - Chris Wright CEng MRAeS, AEROSPACE MAGAZINE August 2016 What a magnificent book! I noticed that the bibliography includes William Green's Aircraft of The World, a copy of which has been the key foundation of my aircraft reference library since 1965. I am proud to place my copy of Classic Light Aircraft on the shelf right next to it. (It is) an authoritative, faithfully-accurate work that is at the same time visually attractive! Jeff Jacobs, Cessna 172 Club Ron Smith has been beavering away at this book for several years and civil aircraft enthusiasts will find it a hugely valuable quick reference guide to the myriad of light aircraft flying all over the world. It is arranged alphabetically by manufacturer and every entry consists of a photo, most being in colour and photographed by the author, and a short extended caption. Aircraft types covered include all the main production models together with a good selection of the more common homebuilts, light sport types and a selection of antiques. The largest types covered are the King Air and Dove - no business jets here. The necessary brevity of the text means some facts are left out - for instance, the only Cirrus mentioned is the SR22 - and the index only refers to the manufacturers and does not allow reference by aircraft name. Having said that, this is a book which will prove very useful all who attend civil fly-ins and events. - Rod Simpson, Aviation World, Autumn 2015. 'Xtended', Europe's premier aerospace internet radio programme, interviewed Ron Smith about general aviation, along with the publication of his new book Classic Light Aircraft Xtended say: "We really enjoyed the book and hope we have helped promote a positive image of it!" Light aircraft do not get much attention from today's mainstream publishers, presumably because there is more demand for military subjects, so it is refreshing to see this new, comprehensive hardback which claims to be An illustrated look, 1920s to the present'. Almost all the images are in colour with a handful of monochrome illustrations, and since most are from the author's collection few will have been seen before. His name may be familiar to readers from the very useful five-volume history 'British-Built Aircraft', and he is an aeronautical engineer, historian and private pilot, so is well qualified to write on this subject. - Mike Hooks Another excellent book from the pen of VAC member Ron Smith on a subject which he is indeed an expert. This book provides an extensive photographic record in alphabetical order by manufacturer of what are considered to be classic light or general aviation aircraft from the 1920s to the present day. To underline the selected time period the range of dates of the photographs compliment diverse dates during the period. The standard both of the photography and the reproduction throughout the book is first rate. Where this book scores for the aviation enthusiast is in that it provides a guide to recognition of types and subtypes of the same marque. The captions to the photographs give, where appropriate details of these differences. This alone will mean that it will be in use as a constant work of reference. This book is a must for the aviation enthusiast is extremely good value for money. - Paul Loveday, Vintage &amp; Classic magazine Personally, I do not have an idea which percentage from the nowadays still flying types are enlisted in this book, but I think it is a high percentage. In some of them I have even co-piloted. For me, this book contains an enormous amount of splendid unknown but also known aircrafts. What do you think of a DH88 Comet or a DH89A Dragon Rapide or a Gee Bee? Who wouldnt want to fly in those?! The book has a pleasant size and lies well in the hand. The book is almost overloaded with pictures and is printed on good paper. Most of the pictures are in colour. When you see all those pictures it becomes clear to you how large this business worldwide is and was. All pictures are accompanied with a short informative text about the aircraft, not too detailed. Ron Smith has produced a beautiful book which is a must have for the General Aviation-freak with focus on the light aircrafts. Good to read and to page through, and blimey this book inspires so much to go flying! Aviation Book Reviews .com LAA member and pilot Ron Smiths latest book is a comprehensive encyclopaedia of light aircraft that might be seen today or in the past 30 years. Illustrated mostly by the authors own photos the book covers 800 types with photos and a small write-up with a little history and details of each. The book covers all of the major production aircraft of the last 30 or so years, plus a lot of the surviving vintage aircraft that might be seen in the UK, US or Australia. Also covered are most of the popular homebuilts from the UK and US together with a few from France and other countries. Some of the more modern European Ultralights/Light Sport aircraft are also included. A great reference guide for anyone wondering what that aircraft they just saw at the local airfield, or fly in was and also a handy guide to anyone to see what aircraft are out there, that they might be interested to fly or buy. - LAA Magazine book review The author knows his stuff and, rather like Eddie Riding, seems to have spent a lifetime wandering around airfields in this county and abroad, photographing every machine of interest and building up a terrific picture of the GA fleet as we know it in Britain, Europe and the USA. It's good to see not just the standard series production types, but typical mix of homebuilts, vintage aeroplanes and pensioned-off military stuff that you will find at most airfields in the UK. Ron has also done his research: as a dutiful reviewer, I picked on types and manufacturers I knew about and looked to see if he had included them: he'd not missed one! - RV March 2016 edition of Pilot Magazine. The author, Ron Smith, is a prolific writer of books on general aviation, covering both historical aspects and specific aircraft types. His previous books have demonstrated a useful knack of being able to cover a lot of ground with the minimum of effort, providing just enough information to keep the appetite whetted and no more. This quite hefty volume continues in the same vein, and so allows for over 800 aircraft types and manufacturers to be represented. The number of photographs is extraordinary, considering most of them were taken by the author. These are of excellent quality and, apart from one or two, in colour, mainly two to a page. I suspect most readers will check if any aircraft they have flown is pictured; I could not resist myself, and sure enough, there was a picture of a Piper Cub I spent many happy hours in, but, from the colour scheme, taken long before I became part-owner. From this, it was evident that Ron had started building his library of photographs a very long time ago. This is a wonderful book for anyone who enjoys and takes an interest in light aircraft, I thoroughly recommend it. - George Done April 2016 LAA member and pilot Ron Smith's latest book is a comprehensive encyclopaedia of all of the major production light aircraft of the last 30 or so years, plus a lot of the surviving vintage aircraft that might be seen in the UK, US or Australia. The book is a great reference guide for anyone wondering just what was that aircraft they saw at the local airfield. It amazes me sometimes how little some pilots know about the variety of aircraft types they could fly and this book covers nearly all of them. Reading the book you really can discover what a wide range of light aircraft have been produced over the years. The aircraft are presented and indexed in alphabetic order by manufacturer so it is easy to look up your favourite types, or find out what that wonderplane really looks like. Overall then an excellent book and well worth the cover price, so I can thoroughly recommend it to LAA members keen to know more about the sheer variety of light aircraft that grace our skies. - Nigel Hitchman, Light Aviation Magazine March 2016 I would have loved owning this book when I was a kid at the bottom of the learning curve. - Kristen Alexander, AeroAustralia Magazine July 2016</p><h2>Stuck-Up Suit</h2><p>From the <b><i>New York Times</i> </b>Bestselling authors of <i>Cocky Bastard</i>, comes a sexy new <b>standalone</b> novel.<br><br>It started out like any other morning on the train.<br>Until I became mesmerized by the guy sitting across the aisle.<br>He was barking at someone on his phone like he ruled the world.<br>Who did the stuck-up suit think he was...God?<br>Actually, he looked like a God.

After quickly exhausting the "Grand Tour" of landmarks popularized by the spiritual tourists of the West, Brooke plunged into wilderness India, and the journey shifted into high gear. </p><p>From their first meeting, Brooke was heralded by Sai Baba, India's greatest miracle-working godman, as the inner-circle disciple who, like Oppenheimer at Los Alamos, would help trigger the explosion of India's ancient mystical tradition into the Western world. </p><p>Within Baba's enchanted realm, Brooke saw and experienced things that seemed to obliterate all Western conceptions of reality as his journey vectored further into an alien universe. What had appeared as the prized state of godlike enlightenment, which seemed just within reach, became a precipicenot of enlightenmentbut obliteration, even possession. Brooke was becoming a captive soul of an ancient inner transformation, while Baba's outward divinity concealed a timeless, demonic presence. </p><p>After two years of surrender to a Being who claimed to be God on earth, something remarkable happened. The end-game of spiritual powers ensnaring one man's soul turned abruptly and miraculously. Poised on the edge of a precipice, Brooke was rescued from above. </p><p>With hauntingly vivid images, unexpected humor, and a profound passion for truth, Brooke lays bare the powerful reality of good and evil and of things beyond the familiar realm of the senses, in a book that will not be easily forgotten.</p></p><p>This book is coming back into print as Avatar of Night, on sale here at Amazon.comThis version of <i>Lord of The Air</i> is the highly abridged International Version released in England.

Yet this is just what Anthony Gottlieb accomplishes in <i>The Dream of Reason</i>, which guides the reader from the earliest Greek philosophers to the pre-Cartesian Renaissance. Gottlieb's project is undeniably ambitious, and by necessity it is big-picture philosophy. But it is exactly this big-picture context that is often lamentably absent from other works of this sort. Gottlieb's skill at rendering historical context makes his account both unusually engaging and surprisingly illuminating. <p> Gottlieb is an admirable guide through the little-understood pre-Socratic philosophers of ancient Greece, giving fair measure to philosophers who are too often simplified or lampooned. His account of Plato and Aristotle is good too, as is his treatment of the later Hellenistic schools, Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Skepticism. Gottlieb's treatment of medieval philosophy, particularly Thomist and Arabic philosophy, is lean, as the author chooses to focus more heavily on antiquity and the modern era (to be continued in a second volume), and the narrative history that bridges the two. Ever enthusiastic, Gottlieb's storytelling voice and character-driven approach make <i>The Dream of Reason</i> compelling reading. It is an ideal book for nonexperts interested in an appealing and informative history of philosophy as well as for students looking for a lucid and comprehensive account of premodern thinkers. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>Anthony Gottlieb is Executive Editor of The Economist. He studied philosophy at Cambridge University and University College London and has been a Visiting Fellow at Harvard University. He writes regularly for the New York Times Book Review and is the author of a short book, Socrates.</p><h2>Lost in the City: A Julie Mystery (American Girl Mysteries / A Julie Mystery)</h2><p>Julie is excited to take care of Lucy, a talking parrot, while her friend Ivy is on vacation.

He was one of the first soldiers to encounter the fledgling insurgency in Iraq. After years of military service he returned to New Orleans to tend bar and deliver groceries. In the weeks before Hurricane Katrina made landfall, he met Addie Hall, a pretty and high-spirited bartender.

It is rarely seen from the perspective of the lowest ranks of the army, and the experience of the ordinary soldiers is less well known and is often misunderstood. That is why this account, based on more than 1,600 letters written by French soldiers of the Napoleonic armies, is of such value. It adds to the existing literature by exploring every aspect of the life of a French soldier during the period 1799-1815. <br> <br>The book will be fascinating and informative reading for military and cultural historians, but it will also appeal to anyone who is interested in the war experience of common soldiers. It offers the English-speaking audience a French view of a conflict which is too often limited to the traditional memoirs of Captain Coignet, Colonel Marbot or Sergeant Bourgogne.</p><p>Dr Bernard Wilkin is a Belgian historian who works at the State Archives of Belgium, where he specializes in the history of the French army and the French people at war, from Napoleon to the end of the Third Republic. He was previously lecturer at the University of Exeter and has published on various subjects such as propaganda in France during the world wars and morale in the French army and on the home front during the Great War.<br><br>Renï¿½ Wilkin, the father of Bernard, studied and taught history in the city of Liï¿½ge where he was born. He is now retired but continues to work on Napoleonic history from a French perspective. Bernard and Renï¿½ Wilkin recently published Fighting for Napoleon: French Soldiers&#x2019; Letters 1799-1815.A superb guide to the experience and motivation of military service that is based on a wide trawl of relevant letters. Built around the collection of the Archives de l'Etat ï¿½ Liï¿½ge which kept more than 1,500 letters, all written by soldiers from the Ourthe department and the vast majority written by conscripts. The organisation is clear and appropriate. Three of the chapters are chronological, dealing with particular conflicts and the records they left, one deals with conscription and desertion, one life in the army, and one wounds, illness and captivity. The authors show that the conscripts mostly perceived compulsory service as a burden, and a heavy one. They argue that Alan Forrest's citation of a letter from an enthusiastic conscript from Liï¿½ge pushed an a typical attitude to the fore, as the vast majority of these soldiers did not fight for France or for any abstract reason. This correction of Forrest is most valuable as the subject suffers from too much selective quotation. The personal prestige of Napoleon is presented as a factor, but the high rate of desertion, especially after 1812, is employed as an appropriate comment on this charisma... A first-rate work that is of much wider significance. - <i>Professor Jeremy Black, French History</i>&nbsp;(Oxford University Press)<br><br>Based on more than 1,600 letters - most of which have never been published before - this work provides the reader with a good insight into the lives of ordinary French of the Napoleonic Wars. These conflicts are rarely seen from the perspective of the lowly 'other ranks' of an army, so the experience of ordinary soldiers is less well known. Direct accounts of campaigns and battle, recruitment and training, barrack life, the experience of captivity and being wounded are all here, based on letters written most by uneducated men to their immediate family. A few illustrations are included as is a chronology of the Napoleonic Wars, a bibliography and an index. This really is fascinating stuff, and surely a 'must' for students of Napoleonic warfare. - <i>Stuart Asquith, Military Modelling, April 2016</i></p><h2>Organic Gardening in Cold Climates</h2><p>Revised and expanded edition of Organic gardening in Montana and the Northwest .

Scott reached the South Pole, only to find he had been beaten by Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition. Scott and his companions faced an 850-mile march to safety. All perished on the return. A few months later, a search party found Scott's body and the journals that told his tragic story.<br> Scott's own account was published to extraordinary acclaim in 1913. This new edition draws on ninety years of reflection on the Antarctic disaster to illuminate Scott's journals, publishing for the first time a complete list of the changes made to Scott's original text. Drawing on previously unused papers from the John Murray archive, Max Jones tells the story of this remarkable book and charts the changing fortunes of Scott's reputation. The first fully annotated edition, it also includes appendixes on J. M. Barrie's <em>Biographical Introduction</em>' and <em>The Finding of the Dead</em>, plus a glossary of names and a full index.<br> The story of Captain Scott and his team is sure to captivate modern readers just as much as it did almost one-hundred years ago.</p><p>In November 1910, a ship called <i>Terra Nova</i> left New Zealand on its way south to Antarctica. On board was an international team of explorers led by Robert Falcon Scott, a man determined to be the first to reach the South Pole. A year and a half later, Scott and three members of his team died during a brutal blizzard. Their dream of reaching the Pole first had already been dashed by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, and now on their return trip--slowed by ill health and bad weather--Scott's party found themselves trapped in a tent without sufficient provisions, while the wind howled endlessly outside. Even in his final hours, Scott found the strength to continue the journal he'd started at the beginning of his adventures; the diary was found beside his frozen body.<p> <i>Scott's Last Expedition: The Journals</i> is the explorer's detailed account of his time in Antarctica. The team's daily progress towards their final goal is recorded in Scott's vivid, personal narrative, as well as his impressions of the harsh conditions, the stark beauty of the tundra, and his own increasingly desperate ambition to beat his rivals to the Pole. Shortly before he died, Scott wrote: "Had we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman." Robert Falcon Scott and his men died, but their story lives on in his journals.</p><br><strong>Max Jones</strong> is a Lecturer in Modern British History at the University of Manchester, England.

A comic strip-style story--involving a stolen parchment and the kidnapping of Catwoman--begins on this volume's front cover. The book opens to reveal the Batcave--our hero's headquarters--complete with working Batcomputer: images of the cowled crusader's arch enemies are displayed on-screen, via a rotating paper dial. The saga of the missing artwork is continued on three large flaps which unfold (around what becomes the center panel) to reveal the elaborate pop-up hideaways of villains Two-Face, Poison Ivy and the fiendish Joker. Pull-tabs activate Two-Face's twin battle-axes and Poison Ivy's man-eating houseplant, while a cleverly engineered cardboard lever allows readers to rescue a trussed Catwoman from a fatal conveyer-belt ride. Punch-out figures of the story's main players can be moved through the locales; a "punch-out storage area" is also provided. The vertiginous perspectives of the moody, detailed artwork are particularly distinctive; however, the truncated plot makes repeated "readings" unlikely.

As <i>Cross and Burn</i> opens, Tony and Carol are facing the biggest challenge of their professional lives: how to live without each other. No one has seen Carol in three months, and without her, the police brass no longer want Tony&#x2019;s services. Even more damaging is the fact that they both hold Tony responsible for the bloody havoc their last case wreaked on Carol&#x2019;s life and family, and Carol has sworn she&#x2019;ll never speak to Tony again. But just because Tony and Carol&#x2019;s relationship is finished doesn&#x2019;t mean the killing is. A body has been discovered in an abandoned flat inhabited by squatters. As connections to other missing or dead women emerge, a horrifying pattern becomes clear: someone is killing women, all of whom bear a striking resemblance to Carol Jordan.

Hidden beneath a skull-emblazoned hoodie, the limber Elizabeth (thank goodness for yoga) walks out of Buckingham Palace into the freedom of a rainy London day and heads for King's Cross to catch a train to Scotland.

This story's success lies in the economy of its prose and its clever layout, spreading a single sentence over a double-page spread with small illustrations surrounding each phrase. The mice are adorable, with all the personality of eager, excited small children at Christmas. Their house is snug and cozy, with pictures hanging to dry, holly festooned everywhere, and a fire roaring in the fireplace. Mimi's Christmas is one worth sharing.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Webster&#39;s American Family Dictionary</h2><p>"I applaud this . . . value-centered, family-oriented dictionary."<br>--The Reverend Billy Graham<br><br><b>A Dictionary Resource for the Whole Family</b><br><br>The aim of <b>Webster's American Family Dictionary</b> is unique and challenging: it is to capture and record the standard vocabulary of American English in a way that reflects the common ethical, moral, religious, social, and civic values of mainstream Americans.

In addressing fundamental questions about the origin and nature of radical abolitionism in this most American of towns, Sandra Harbert Petrulionis frames the antislavery ideology of Henry Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x2015;two of Concord's most famous residents&#x2015;as a product of family and community activism and presents the civic context in which their outspoken abolitionism evolved.</p><p>In this historic locale, radical abolitionism crossed racial, class, and gender lines as a confederation of neighbors fomented a radical consciousness, and Petrulionis documents how the Thoreaus, Emersons, and Alcotts worked in tandem with others in their community, including a slaveowner's daughter and a former slave. Additionally, she examines the basis on which Henry Thoreau&#x2015;who cherished nothing more than solitary tramps through his beloved woods and bogs&#x2015;has achieved lasting fame as a militant abolitionist.</p><p>This book marshals rich archival evidence of the diverse tactics exploited by a small coterie of committed activists, largely women, who provoked their famous neighbors to action. In Concord, the fugitive slave Shadrach Minkins was clothed and fed as he made his way to freedom. In Concord, the adolescent daughters of John Brown attended school and recovered from their emotional distress after their father's notorious public hanging. Although most residents of the town maintained a practiced detachment from the plight of the enslaved, women and men whose sole objective was the moral urgency of abolishing slavery at last prevailed on the philosophers of self-culture to accept the responsibility of their reputations.</p></p><p><p>Sandra Harbert Petrulionis is Associate Professor of English at Penn State Altoona. She is the editor of<i> Journal 8: 1854 in The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau</i> and coeditor of <i>More Day to Dawn: Thoreau's Walden for the Twenty-First Century</i>.</p><p>"Henry David Thoreau liked to boast that he marched to a different drummer, but when it came to protesting slavery, his mother, sisters, and aunts set the beat. As Sandra Harbert Petrulionis demonstrates in fine detail and lively prose, female abolitionists were the driving force behind the antislavery activism for which Concord, Massachusetts, became legendary in antebellum America. Spurning the expediency of politicians and the abstractions of Transcendentalists, the women of Concord labored tirelessly for three decades to protest the sin of slavery in a nation supposedly devoted to liberty and equality. In the town famous for the battle that launched the Revolutionary War, women fired their own 'shot heard round the world' in the protracted struggle to realize the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. In charting their sacrifices and contributions, Petrulionis restores the women of Concord to their rightful role in the contest against slavery and the shaping of the New England tradition of reform."</p> (Robert A. Gross, University of Connecticut, author of <i>The Minutemen and Their World</i>)<br><br><p>"It is a refreshing change to read an elegantly crafted book which understands that writers like Emerson lived in a precise place and time and were influenced by the world around them.

Was their rejection of conventional forms of political organization a fatal flaw or were the apparent weaknesses of the movement -- the lack of central authority, the distrust of politics -- actually hidden strengths?<p>Wini Breines traces the evolution of the New Left movement through the Free Speech Movement, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and SDS's community organization projects. For Breines, the movement's goal of participatory decision-making, even when it was not achieved, made up for its failure to take practical and direct action. By the late 1960s, antiwar activism contributed to the decline of the New Left, as the movement was flooded with new participants who did not share the founding generation's political experiences or values.</p><p>Originally published in 1982, Wini Breines's classic work now includes a new preface in which she reassesses, and for the most part affirms, her initial views of the movement. She argues that the movement remains effective in the midst of radical changes in activist movements. Breines also summarizes and evaluates the new and growing scholarship on the 1960s. Her provocative analysis of the New Left remains important today.</p></p><p>&#34;A valuable perspective on student movements and politics&#34;. -- Choice</p><h2>The Power of Pentecost</h2><p>he Power of Pentecost by Dr. John R.

Bass, author of The Deer Pasture and award-winning short stories, displays equal imagination and intelligence in these journal-form entries. Relating oil with life--certain that neither will last forever--he reflects on his relationships with his family and his work. Bass tells us how a landowner gets paid for an oil well; he discusses state laws for the gas and oil industry ("brutally fair") and introduces a drill crew. He rescues a pair of abandoned puppies from the roadside, spends a weekend well-sitting. With the awareness and eye of a naturalist and a writer's gift with language, he offers a low-key, upbeat work that celebrates youthful energy and optimism. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Appomattox Campaign: March 29-april 9, 1865 (Great Campaigns Series)</h2><p>Previous accounts of the Civil War&#39;s last major campaign have often neglected the actual maneuvers and tactics of the units involved. This new addition to the Great Campaigns series features a tactical approach to the final drama of the Civil War. Innovative maps, sidebars and charts complement a dramatic narrative. The fall of Petersburg and Richmond, the last battles at Five Forks, Sailor&#39;s Creek, and Dinwiddie Court House, and the final surrender at Appomattox are all described by an author whose knowledge of the historical sources is equaled by his familiarity with the area over which the armies marched and fought.The author provides a day-to-day narrative of this fascinating campaign, with a series of specially commissioned maps that make clear the complex series of maneuvers that finally brought Lee&#39;s beleaguered army to bay. Special sidebars highlight many incidents and personalities of the campaign, including never-before-published information on African-Americans in Confederate service. Record-keeping, especially for the Confederates, was difficult in the last hectic days of the war, and readers will find here the most complete order of battle available for both sides.</p><p>Chris M.

However, Robert Lyman reveals here how in the summer of 1941, beleaguered British forces put together a series of largely forgotten victories in Iraq, Syria and Iran that secured crucial supplies of oil and curbed dangerous German expansion in the region. It&#39;s an exciting story of victories achieved against the odds - fraught negotiations between London, Cairo and New Delhi, hastily assembled troops and campaigns fought and won in harsh desert conditions. The siege of the RAF base at Lake Habbaniya in Iraq is a brilliant example of this, and forms one of the most exciting passages in the book. 1941 could have been the year in which Britain lost the war - Lyman reveals here how close we came.</p><p>Major Robert Lyman was an officer in the British Army for twenty years.

The result of his efforts is a story of rebellion and escape from civilization which continues to attract and captivate readers to this day. Introduction by Perry Meisel.</p><p>8 1-hour cassettesThis is the story of an artist who was willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of art. In much of its general outline, this famous novel follows the life of Paul Gauguin, famous French post-impressionist painter, but it is not a novelized biography of Gauguin. Rather it is a sharply delineated, carefully wrought "private life", written by one of the most vivid and penetrating contemporary literary masters.<p>Charles Strickland, the central character, was a stock broker in London. One day, at the age of forty, he left his business, his wife and their children and went to Paris. He had neither money nor prospects. He knew almost nothing of art. But he was seized with a passion to paint and for the rest of his life nothing else mattered to him. He gave up everything to which he had been accustomed for extreme poverty, social ostracism and the freedom to paint. When he finally died of leprosy in Tahiti, where he had gone native, the few paintings which turned up for sale brought only six to ten francs apiece. But he had achieved his desire to create beauty and with the years, the world fully recognized his blazing genius.</p></p><h2>The Official Get Rich Guide to Information Marketing: Build a Million-Dollar Business in 12 Months: Build a Million Dollar Business in Just 12 Months</h2><p><p>Welcome to the information marketing industry - a little-known industry of entrepreneurs, most working only part-time hours and netting seven-figure profits. </p><p>Info-marketers gather information and sell it in convenient forms to people who need it.

To move house by boat, to get a child with a broken leg to a hospital, or to set off for school one morning, only to find that the streets have become rivers and the playground is a lake full of sewage? When Polly Coles and her family left England for Venice, they discovered a city caught between modern and ancient life&#x2014;where the locals still go on an annual pilgrimage to give thanks for the end of the Black Death, where schools are housed in renaissance palaces, and your new washing machine can only be delivered on foot. This is a city perilously under siege from tourism, but its people refuse to give it up&#x2014;indeed they love it with a passion. This book&nbsp;is a fascinating window into the world of ordinary Venetians and the strange and unique place they call home.</p><p><b>Polly Coles</b> is an anthropologist who writes both fiction and nonfiction, and, most recently, has written texts to accompany two exhibitions at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, England.With four children in tow, Coles and her husband move from the comfort of an English village to live and work in Venice. The tourist vision of a baroque city floating in ineffable beauty above the Adriatic mist gives way to the reality of conducting life, finding an apartment, getting kids to school, shopping without a car, dealing with medical emergencies, and learning to contend with cranky natives bickering endlessly in the incomprehensible local dialect over what defines a real Venetian. Her brood of energetic kids makes her stand out in a city stagnating from a swiftly declining birthrate, and the children have trouble thriving in authoritarian, eager-to-punish classrooms. Coles learns to hang laundry outdoors properly and teaches herself to row a boat only to feature in tourist photos. Anyone who has visited Venice will find this dose of reality sharply, yet lovingly, contrasts with la serenissima&#x2019;s fairy-tale facade. --Mark Knoblauch</p><h2>Unremembered</h2><p><p>When Freedom Airlines flight 121 went down over the Pacific Ocean, no one ever expected to find survivors. Which is why the sixteen-year-old girl discovered floating among the wreckage&#x2015;alive&#x2015;is making headlines across the globe.</p><p>Even more strange is that her body is miraculously unharmed and she has no memories of boarding the plane. She has no memories of her life before the crash. She has no memories <i>period</i>. No one knows how she survived. No one knows why she wasn't on the passenger manifest. And no one can explain why her DNA and fingerprints can't be found in a single database in the world.</p><p>Crippled by a world she doesn't know, plagued by abilities she doesn't understand, and haunted by a looming threat she can't remember, Seraphina struggles to piece together her forgotten past and discover who she really is. But with every clue only comes more questions. And she's running out of time to answer them. </p><p>Her only hope is a strangely alluring boy who claims to know her from before the crash.

And will he be able to protect her from the people who have been making her forget?</p><p>From popular young adult author Jessica Brody, <i>Unremembered </i>is the start of a compelling and suspenseful new sci-fi series, set in a world where science knows no boundaries, memories are manipulated, and true love can never be forgotten.</p></p><p><p>Jessica Brody is the author of 52 Reasons to Hate My Father, My Life Undecided, and The Karma Club, as well as two adult novels: The Fidelity Files and Love Under Cover<i>.</i> Sometimes she wishes her memories could be erased so she could reread all her favorite books for the first time. She splits her time between California and Colorado.</p>1<br>ANEW<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Today is the only day I remember. Waking up in that ocean is all I have. The rest is empty space. Although I don&#x2019;t know how far back that space goes&#x2014;how many years it spans. That&#x2019;s the thing about voids: they can be as short as the blink of an eye, or they can be infinite. Consuming your entire existence in a flash of meaningless white. Leaving you with nothing.<br>No memories.<br>No names.<br>No faces.<br>Every second that ticks by is new. Every feeling that pulses through me is foreign. Every thought in my brain is like nothing I&#x2019;ve ever thought before. And all I can hope for is one moment that mirrors an absent one. One fleeting glimpse of familiarity.<br>Something that makes me&nbsp;... <i>me</i>.<br>Otherwise, I could be anyone.<br>Forgetting who you are is so much more complicated than simply forgetting your name. It&#x2019;s also forgetting your dreams. Your aspirations. What makes you happy. What you pray you&#x2019;ll never have to live without. It&#x2019;s meeting yourself for the first time, and not being sure of your first impression.<br>After the rescue boat docked, I was brought here. To this room. Men and women in white coats flutter in and out. They stick sharp things in my arm. They study charts and scratch their heads. They poke and prod and watch me for a reaction. They want something to be wrong with me. But I assure them that I&#x2019;m fine. That I feel no pain.<br>The fog around me has finally lifted. Objects are crisp and detailed. My head no longer feels as though it weighs a hundred pounds. In fact, I feel strong. Capable. Anxious to get out of this bed. Out of this room with its unfamiliar chemical smells. But they won&#x2019;t let me. They insist I need more time.<br>From the confusion I see etched into their faces, I&#x2019;m pretty sure it&#x2019;s <i>they</i> who need the time.<br>They won&#x2019;t allow me to eat any real food. Instead they deliver nutrients through a tube in my arm. It&#x2019;s inserted directly into my vein. Inches above a thick white plastic bracelet with the words <i>Jane Doe</i> printed on it in crisp black letters.<br>I ask them why I need to be here when I&#x2019;m clearly not injured. I have no visible wounds. No broken bones. I wave my arms and turn my wrists and ankles in wide circles to prove my claim. But they don&#x2019;t respond. And this infuriates me.<br>After a few hours, they determine that I&#x2019;m sixteen years old. I&#x2019;m not sure how I&#x2019;m supposed to react to this information. I don&#x2019;t <i>feel</i> sixteen. But then again, how do I know what sixteen feels like? How do I know what <i>any</i> age feels like?<br>And how can I be sure that they&#x2019;re right? For all I know, they could have just made up that number. But they assure me that they have qualified tests. Specialists. Experts. And they all say the same thing.<br>That I&#x2019;m sixteen.<br>The tests can&#x2019;t tell me my name, though. They can&#x2019;t tell me where I&#x2019;m from. Where I live. Who my family is. Or even my favorite color.<br>And no matter how many &#x201c;experts&#x201d; they shuttle in and out of this room, no one can seem to explain why I&#x2019;m the only survivor of the kind of plane crash no one survives.<br>They talk about something called a passenger manifest. I&#x2019;ve deduced that it&#x2019;s a kind of master list. A register of everyone who boarded the plane.<br>I&#x2019;ve also deduced that I&#x2019;m not on it.<br>And that doesn&#x2019;t seem to be going over very well with anyone.<br>A man in a gray suit, who identifies himself as Mr. Rayunas from Social Services, says he&#x2019;s trying to locate my next of kin. He carries around a strange-looking metal device that he calls a cell phone. He holds it up to his ear and talks. He also likes to stare at it and stab at tiny buttons on its surface. I don&#x2019;t know what my &#x201c;next of kin&#x201d; is, but by the look on his face, he&#x2019;s having trouble locating it.<br>He whispers things to the others. Things I&#x2019;m assuming he doesn&#x2019;t want me to hear. But I hear them anyway. Foreign, unfamiliar words like &#x201c;foster care&#x201d; and &#x201c;the press&#x201d; and &#x201c;minor.&#x201d; Every so often they all pause and glance over at me. They shake their heads. Then they continue whispering.<br>There&#x2019;s a woman named Kiyana who comes in every hour. She has dark skin and speaks with an accent that makes it sound like she&#x2019;s singing. She wears pink. She smiles and fluffs my pillow. Presses two fingers against my wrist. Writes stuff down on a clipboard. I&#x2019;ve come to look forward to her visits. She&#x2019;s kinder than the others. She takes the time to talk to me. Ask me questions. Real ones. Even though she knows I don&#x2019;t have any of the answers.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re jus&#x2019; so beautiful,&#x201d; she says to me, tapping her finger tenderly against my cheek. &#x201c;Like one of those pictures they airbrush for the fashion magazines, you know?&#x201d;<br>I don&#x2019;t know. But I offer her a weak smile regardless. For some reason, it feels like an appropriate response.<br>&#x201c;Not a blemish,&#x201d; she goes on. &#x201c;Not one flaw. When you get your memory back, you&#x2019;re gonna have to tell me your secret, love.&#x201d; Then she winks at me.<br>I like that she says <i>when</i> and not <i>if</i>.<br>Even though I don&#x2019;t remember learning those words, I understand the difference.<br>&#x201c;And those eyes,&#x201d; she croons, moving in closer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen sucha color. Lavender, almos&#x2019;.&#x201d; She pauses, thinking, and leans closer still. &#x201c;No. <i>Violet.</i>&#x201d; She smiles like she&#x2019;s stumbled upon a long-lost secret. &#x201c;I bet that&#x2019;s your name. Violet. Ring any bells?&#x201d;<br>I shake my head. Of course it doesn&#x2019;t.<br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she says, straightening the sheets around my bed, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna call you that anyway. Jus&#x2019; until you remember the real one. Much nicer soundin&#x2019; than Jane Doe.&#x201d;<br>She takes a step back, tilts her head to the side. &#x201c;Sucha pretty girl. Do you even remember whatcha look like, love?&#x201d;<br>I shake my head again.<br>She smiles softly. Her eyes crinkle at the corners. &#x201c;Hang on then. I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d;<br>She leaves the room. Returns a moment later with an oval-shaped mirror. Light bounces off it as she walks to my bedside. She holds it up.<br>A face appears in the light pink frame.<br>One with long and sleek honey-brown hair. Smooth golden skin. A small, straight nose. Heart-shaped mouth. High cheekbones. Large, almond-shaped purple eyes.<br>They blink.<br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s you,&#x201d; she says. And then, &#x201c;You musta been a model. Such perfection.&#x201d;<br>But I don&#x2019;t see what she sees. I only see a stranger. A person I don&#x2019;t recognize. A face I don&#x2019;t know. And behind those eyes are sixteen years of experiences I fear I&#x2019;ll never be able to remember. A life held prisoner behind a locked door. And the only key has been lost at sea.<br>I watch purple tears form in the reflecting glass.<br>2<br>COVERAGE<br>&#x201c;Mystery continues to cloud the tragic crash of Freedom Airlines flight 121, which went down over the Pacific Ocean yesterday evening after taking off from Los Angeles International Airport on a nonstop journey to Tokyo, Japan. Experts are working around the clock to determine the identity of the flight&#x2019;s only known survivor, a sixteen-year-old girl who was found floating among the wreckage, relatively unharmed. Doctors at UCLA Medical Center, where she&#x2019;s being treated, confirm that the young woman has suffered severe amnesia and does not remember anything prior to the crash. There was no identification found on the girl and the Los Angeles Police have been unable to match her fingerprints or DNA to any government databases. According to a statement announced by the FAA earlier this morning, she was not believed to be traveling with family and no missing-persons reports matching her description have been filed.<br>&#x201c;The hospital released this first photo of the girl just today, in the hope that someone with information will step forward.

Red Flannel loves Rosebud, but she isn't interested in such a coarse fellow. One day a sudden snowstorm threatens to freeze them on the line, and they take off together on a harrowing adventure. Ethel Pochocki has created a hero and heroine of timeless appeal, and Mary Beth Owens's energetic watercolors infuse them with radiant life. What Rosebud and Red Flannel find within themselves&#x2014;and in each other&#x2014;will warm every heart.</p><p>Award-winning author Ethel Pochocki wrote many books for children, including The Attic Mice, Rosebud and Red Flannel, and Maine Marmalade. A long-time resident of Brooks, Maine, Ms. Pochocki died in December 2010.<br><br>Artist and illustrator Mary Beth Owens collaborated with Ethel Pochocki on several books. Parenting magazine selected Owens's book A Caribou Alphabet as one of the ten best picture books of 1991, and her book Prize in the Snow was awarded the 1995 Lupine Award and the Christopher Award. Ms. Owens lives in Walpole, Maine.<br>Hanging on the line with the rest of the wash, Rosebud (a beauteous nightgown) chooses to ignore Red Flannel (the well-worn long johns), who loves her dearly. Rosebud has no use for this "coarse fellow." After all, the lace-edged nightgown was made by hand in France, while the long johns were purchased from the bargain table at an Army-Navy surplus store. Despite Rosebud's indifference, Red Flannel continually somersaults about in the wind, trying to impress her. One winter day, in the middle of a fierce snowstorm that blows the clothes high into the air, the devoted garment puts his life on the line for her, and she finally recognizes his worth. Employing many fanciful and heartwarming touches, Pochocki tells a sweet, if slightly corny story. Yet it is Owens's detail-rich watercolors--equally effectively depicting tranquil interior scenes and the raging blizzard outdoors--that steal the show.

This is her first novel.Death imitates art in Davis's playful debut about crime novelist and wisecracking interracial Bay Area hipster Sophie Katz, who possesses either an overactive imagination or a keen awareness of criminal behavior patterns. When rapper JJ Money and the movie producer interested in optioning Sophie's novel both die in scenes lifted from their respective works, Sophie is the only one who sees the connection. Soon, it seems someone is reenacting the ominous details (vandalized car, crank calls, mysteriously broken wine glass) of her bestseller, and she fears that she's the next target. Sophie turns a suspicious eye on sexy bad-boy Russian-Israeli Anatoly Darinsky: he's either a homicidal stalker or prime boyfriend material. When the San Francisco police scoff at Sophie's suspicions, the plucky writer turned amateur sleuth enlists her less-than-intrepid circle of friends; drawn in broad strokes, they include gay hairstylist Marcus, clueless wallflower Mary Ann and savvy sex-toy aficionado Dena. Davis keeps the tone light throughout, as Sophie maintains her irreverent sense of humor even as the peril mounts. Though the story serves as a book-length ad for Starbucks, as the title unfortunately hints, and Sophie's over-the-top scheming can strain credibility more than it amuses, readers sympathetic to the relentlessly sassy heroine will find this a thoroughly readable romp. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>The Black Prince of Florence,</i> a dramatic tale of assassination, spies and betrayal, the first retelling of Alessandro's life in two-hundred years opens a window onto the opulent, cut-throat world of Renaissance Italy.</b> <p>The year is 1531. After years of brutal war and political intrigue, the bastard son of a Medici Duke and a &#x2018;half-negro&#x2019; maidservant rides into Florence. Within a year, he rules the city as its Prince. Backed by the Pope and his future father-in-law the Holy Roman Emperor, the nineteen-year-old Alessandro faces down bloody family rivalry and the scheming hostility of Italy&#x2019;s oligarchs to reassert the Medicis&#x2019; faltering grip on the turbulent city-state. Six years later, as he awaits an adulterous liaison, he will be murdered by his cousin in another man&#x2019;s bed.</p> <p>From dazzling palaces and Tuscan villas to the treacherous backstreets of Florence and the corridors of papal power, the story of Alessandro&#x2019;s spectacular rise, magnificent reign and violent demise takes us deep beneath the surface of power in Renaissance Italy &#x2013; a glamorous but deadly realm of spies, betrayal and vendetta, illicit sex and fabulous displays of wealth, where the colour of one&#x2019;s skin meant little but the strength of one&#x2019;s allegiances meant everything.</p></p><p><b>Catherine Fletcher</b> is a historian of Renaissance and early modern Europe.

After all, Charles was not only a leading manufacturer, but also a noted philanthropist. But when murder is the result of their meeting, Jack Haldean takes up the case, in a desperate bid to save a man from the gallows. But what led to the crime? The answer is Off the Record . . .</p></p><p>.The BBC made its first radio broadcast in 1922 and, all of a sudden, the entire British gramophone industry was in crisis.Radio was cool. I've got a photo of my mother (she was born in 1922) as a very little girl, in a sweet sticky-out dress, wearing radio headphones. Her family were mill-workers and not remotely well-off, but they, like everyone else, wanted to "Listen in". I built my own crystal radio, partly for fun, partly to see how it worked, and it's amazing, as you stroke the "cat's whisker" over the copper wire, to hear voices coming from the empty air. &nbsp;It's a form of magic that simply pressing a button doesn't evoke.It's no wonder that boring old records, with their tinny sound, were yesterday. &nbsp;The recording method, a straightforward acoustical system, hadn't really changed since Edison's day. Record manufacturers had to find a new system and the answer lay in electronics, which gave a richer, far more life-like sound.That feeling of crisis, that desperate search, that "edge" if you will, is what's behind the story of Off The Record. There was a fortune to be made by the first to invent a commercial electronic system and where there's money there's a motive. &nbsp;There's also a mystery, intrigue, bodies and bafflement. &nbsp;With that wonderful ease enjoyed by writers, I built a whole Ideal Village and Factory where the story could start, to contrast Edwardian ease with the after-the-war urgency and there, in this veritable Eden, passions rise and bodies start to fall...<p><strong>Dolores Gordon-Smith</strong>&nbsp;is a British author.

Peeved at the fact that all the plays they see are satires on the lives and values of London's citizenry, the Grocer and his wife interrupt and demand a play that instead contains chivalric quests and courtly love. What's more, they nominate their apprentice Rafe to take on the hero's role of the knight in this entirely new play.</p><p>The author, Francis Beaumont, ends up not just satirising the grocers' naive taste for romance but parodying his own example of citizen comedy. This play-within-a-play becomes a pastiche of contemporary plays that scorned those who were not courtiers or at least gentlemen or ladies.

Of course Edward turns out to be a growly old man who wants his book - &#34;Puppy Love&#34; - to consist mainly of his amorous encounters with women from the dog show community. It&#39;s juicy gossip, but not dangerous...until Andrew, Edward&#39;s son, pays Melanie an angry visit to stop her from working on the book. When Andrew suddenly turns up very dead, the victim of a seemingly intentional hit-and-run, the police are looking at Edward as Suspect No. 1. There was lots of bad blood between Andrew and his father, but Melanie is looking at the bigger picture. Would some of Edwards&#39; ex-trysts have gone after Andrew to shut Edward up? How about all of those husbands and boyfriends with bones to pick? And who is that woman who everyone is avoiding at the funeral? Between getting caught up in the bafflingly dysfunctional March family, sorting out two generations of disgruntled ex lovers, and uncovering a shocking case of secret hoarding, Melanie&#39;s running into dead ends almost as fast as she&#39;s running out of time.

Andrew, Edward's adult son, is struck and killed by a car while jogging, and Edward insists that Melanie take responsibility for investigating whatever the police might have missed.

She agrees to help Edward March, a crotchety but highly influential dog-show judge, write his memoirs, but is dismayed to learn that he's planned a tell-all book about his numerous affairs with well-known women within the dog breeding and show world. Almost immediately, Edward's son, Andrew, vows to stop the book's publication, only to become a hit-and-run victim several days later. Edward insists Melanie help find the killer, but this requires combing through the huge pool of suspects created by father and son's shared philandering ways. Juggling two kids, a husband, and a houseful of poodles, Melanie is one busy lady as she gets on the killer's trail. With unexpected twists, humor, and a wealth of information about the story's milieu, Berenson wraps this caper up in a tail-wagging finale. Agent: Meg Ruley, Jane Rotrosen Agency.

He is a good man and he is happy. But one day, he receives a call from his daughter&#39;s school to inform him that, for no apparent reason, fifteen-year-old Miriam has collapsed and stopped breathing. In that moment, he is plunged into a world of waiting, agonising, not knowing. The story of his life and the lives of his family are rewritten and re-told around this shocking central event, around a body that has inexplicably failed. In this exceptionally courageous and unflinching novel of contemporary life Sarah Moss goes where most of us wouldn&#39;t dare to look, and the result is riveting - unbearably sad, but also miraculously funny and ultimately hopeful. The Tidal Zone explores parental love, overwhelming fear, illness and recovery. It is about clever teenagers and the challenges of marriage. It is about the NHS, academia, sex and gender in the twenty-first century, the work-life juggle, and the politics of packing lunches and loading dishwashers.

Vicki Le?n brought a light and thoughtful touch to women's history in her earlier books, and she brings the same joy and singular voice to the daily work of the ancient world. You'll be surprised to learn how bloody an editor's job used to be, how even a slave could purchase a <i>vicarius</i> to carry out his duties and that early Greeks had their own ghost-busters with the apt title of <i>psychopompus</i>. </p><p>In addition to stand-alone profiles on callings, trades, and professions, Le?n offers numerous sidebar entries about actual people who performed these jobs, giving a human face to the ancient workplace.

She lives in Morro Bay, California.</p>Remember that Metropolitan gala in <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>, where Miranda Priestly has someone whisper in her ear the name of everyone she meets? Well, ancient Roman politicians had such an aide, too: he was called a nomenclator. Leï¿½n entertainingly introduces us to this and other colorful professions held by men and women in Greco-Roman society. With short, humorous anecdotes, she describes the daily grind of scribes, vestal virgins, fishmongers, astronomers, sophists, hoplite slaves, sellers of purple, curse-tablet makers, funeral clowns, sycophants and orgy planners. Scribes, for example, were speed writers who not only recorded public information but also acted as journalists jotting down juicy tales of love, death and political intrigue in the Daily Record. The beast supplier, or <i>praepositus camelorum,</i> tracked, captured and supplied all the animals used in gladiatorial contests and circuses in Rome. Leï¿½n weaves sketches of actual people employed in these professions. Banker's son Apollodorus, a rich-kid-turned-lawyer, litigated a 19-year lawsuit after his father willed his fortune to an ex-slave. Drawing on the same outrageous sense of humor that's made her Uppity Women series so popular, Leï¿½n demonstrates how uncannily similar the workaday experiences of the ancient world are to ours.

Spouses and parents are overwhelmingly emotional and impulsive in their behaviour with each other and their children. There is little reason and judgement governing actions and relationships. Human beings blindly adopt a life set by predecessors. The intellect, lacking development and strength, hardly plays a part in the conduct of their business and home. Consequently, families are torn apart, business houses collapse and nations are at daggers drawn. While governing bodies in the fields of education, politics and religion helplessly gaze at the internal and external crises that humanity faces. The solution lies in developing a powerful intellect to gain suzerainty over the perennial confrontations of the world.</p><p></p><h2>Robert Lowell : Poems Selected by Michael Hofmann</h2><p>The response of one writer to the work of another can be doubly illuminating.

He teaches international affairs at Columbia University. </p>Excerpt<br>Gentiana is a small restaurant that would scarcely warrant a second glance in any other village in Europe. It is rather traditional, only slightly more charming than the bland shops and modest hotels around it. One nearby storefront offers a remarkable array of Swiss Army knives, another boxes of chocolates, another fur hats and mountain gear. The restaurant has a cozy, neighborhood feel to it. Beside the door there is a blackboard highlighting a few specials, and on the ground floor there may be seating for twenty if they are both thin enough and friendly enough. Upstairs there are a few small rooms for private parties, the biggest of which seats ten people squeezed in on either side of a long narrow table. Most of its character comes from a feel of woody intimacy, the dark wood faï¿½ade, dark wood floors, dark wood tables. In fact, for all its charm, it is definitely not a place for claustrophobes&#x2014;or people with an extreme fear of splinters.&nbsp;The reason to go to Gentiana is the fondue, especially the cheese fondue, which is offered in robust portions that recall an era before cardiologists. My wife, Adrean, has a special weakness for fondue, and every year that we have gone to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos we have gone to Gentiana for her birthday. We make reservations long in advance because during the week of the January meetings, which are attended each year by more than 2,000 business and government leaders from around the world, getting a table at Gentiana is not much easier than getting one at renowned eateries like Aragawa in Tokyo, Gordon Ramsay in London, or Le Bernardin in New York. Perhaps more surprisingly, for that one week the clientele at this humble Swiss bistro looks pretty much the same as what you might find at those world-class restaurants.&nbsp;Of course, even during that week, there are still a few tables at Gentiana occupied by locals. One regular is a particularly garrulous drunk who loves to hobnob with the CEOs, heads of state, and rock stars who are wedged in, elbow to elbow, spinning hunks of bread on long forks in the pots of bubbling Gruyï¿½re. The local speaks only Swiss-German to the polyglot crowds around him, and few understand him, although judging by his demeanor the casual observer is not sure whether that has to do with the language he speaks or the local beer that he favors. No matter. He smiles and they smile, and the general effect is cheerful and relaxed.&nbsp;One afternoon during a recent Davos, my wife and I were hurrying along the sidewalk on our way to Gentiana. This can be dangerous, as the locals do not shovel away the snow and ice lurks just about everywhere. In fact, attendees at Davos can see with some regularity central bank governors and senior executives of the IMF and other distinguished middle-aged men and women swaddled in cashmere, calfskin, and politically incorrect pelts of many origins launched skyward, only to land on their broader, softer regions. We walked gingerly, therefore, but with purpose, knowing we were meeting our friends in just a few minutes.&nbsp;The weather was typical. A light snow was falling. It was very cold. But the Alpine air was crisp and dry and invigorating. We chatted about the meetings, who we had seen and who we hoped to run into. As we walked, we reflexively did what most of the visitors to this small mountain town do: We glanced at the people passing us in the street, trying to determine who they were. (Given the nature of Davos, they were likely to have been somebody.) It&#x2019;s a ritual made easier by the fact that everyone at the meeting has to wear a badge around his or her neck at all times. The badge is used to get through the many security checkpoints&#x2014;there are at least two Swiss soldiers and policemen in Davos for every delegate who attends the meetings&#x2014;to register for sessions, and to let everyone know who you are. Your name is on the badge, along with the organization you represent. So too is your picture. People tend to walk with their badges dangling in plain sight so they don&#x2019;t have to fumble with them getting in and out of buildings or past police. That&#x2019;s how it was for everyone except for the universally recognizable&#x2014;people like Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Tony Blair, Bono, or Angelina Jolie. The badge-scanning move is so ubiquitous you might call it the Davos dip: Bend the knee slightly, cast a subtle glance downward, assess and move on.&nbsp;Leaving the Congress Centre and walking along Davos&#x2019;s main street, the Promenade, we passed Thierry Desmarest, the CEO of Total; a small cluster of Harvard professors; a senior executive of Saudi Aramco; and a woman pulling her two small children on a sled. (She was local and the sled seemed to hint at the reason they don&#x2019;t shovel the sidewalks.) We stopped briefly to chat with Tom Donohue, the CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who happens to be my wife&#x2019;s boss, then paused a few steps later to chat with an Indian-born U.S. venture capitalist with whom I had some business. It was a typical sample. Five minutes along the Davos Promenade in January offered a cavalcade of freeze-dried economic leaders from three continents.&nbsp;About two blocks from Gentiana, I was grousing about how one of the conversations that I had most wanted to have had resulted in a frustrating series of near misses. The objective was a long-delayed chat with Paulo Coelho, the Brazilian author of The Alchemist. Coelho has sold more than one hundred million copies of his books worldwide and is, after the Harry Potter&nbsp; author, J. K. Rowling, the second-best-selling author on the planet. He is also one of the few cultural regulars at Davos, one of a handful of people who might offer a different perspective on the Davos zeitgeist. We had intended to meet almost a year earlier but, due to a series of scheduling mishaps, had repeatedly failed to do so. Finally, we aimed for Davos, but I had yet to lay eyes on him. What did I expect from a man who lived on the other side of the world and was constantly in motion&#x2014;a Brazilian who lived much of the time in Europe and sold many of his books in Russia? There was a little bit of hubris in thinking we might ever be able to end up in the same place at the same time. And then: &#x201c;Oh, my God,&#x201d; said a voice I did not recognize, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s you.&#x201d;&nbsp;A smallish man in a fur hat was staring at my name badge. He had a graying goatee, and he greeted me like a long-lost cousin. It was Coelho, appearing almost miraculously out of the Alpine mist as if conjured by our conversation.&nbsp;Passing along the sidewalk from the Congress Centre where we had just heard an address by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and comments from the Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, through the stream of big name boulevardiers, and then walking directly into this icon of the global literary scene&#x2014;it was made clear again that Davos was truly the incarnation of Marshall McLuhan&#x2019;s global village. It was like small-town Planet Earth, or the once-a-year Brigadoon of globalization: a community connected to everywhere and, in one way or another, to everyone. Indeed, during the course of this meeting, top trade ministers would caucus to try unsuccessfully to rescue global trade talks, Africa activists would meet with corporate chiefs and political leaders to seek funding for medical aid programs, global warming would &#x201c;go mainstream&#x201d; as mostly American skeptics were persuaded by session after session of expert views, and proponents of different solutions for dealing with everything from anxiety about immigrants to anxiety about terrorism would present their views directly to those in a position to implement them.

They compared workers toiling in America's sprawling factories to animals, children, and robots. Working people regularly defied these expectations, cultivating the knowledge of experience and embracing a vibrant subculture of self-education and reading. Labor's Mind uses diaries and personal correspondence, labor college records, and a range of print and visual media to recover this social history of the working-class mind. As Higbie shows, networks of working-class learners and their middle-class allies formed nothing less than a shadow labor movement. Dispersed across the industrial landscape, this movement helped bridge conflicts within radical and progressive politics even as it trained workers for the transformative new unionism of the 1930s. Revelatory and sympathetic, Labor's Mind reclaims a forgotten chapter in working-class intellectual life while mapping present-day possibilities for labor, higher education, and digitally enabled self-study.</p></p><p>Tobias Higbie is an associate professor of history at UCLA.

Based on the idea that individuals cannot be fully healthy in a society filled with dysfunctional systems, the authors concentrate on those behavioral models that successfully help individuals to change (i.e., the recovery model, the Twelve Circles of the Iroquois Nation) and how these models can then be applied to unhealthy social structures. </p><blockquote>"Without question, the addictive paradigms that bind us to society (and often to each other) also hinder our growth as free-thinking individuals. This deeply researched book not only exposes these addictive systems, but provides a new vision of recovery by insisting that we change the lenses through which we see our world. It then becomes the compass rather than the rigid road map by which we lead our lives -- thus enabling us to break with the traditionally binding patterns of today."<br>--Steven Covey, founder and chairman of the Covey Leadership Center and author of the number one best-seller, <i>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.</i> <p>"This is an excellent and eminently readable book. The metaphoric comparison between addiction and cultural belief systems is powerful. The book raises the critical question for our time: Can you have healthy persons in an unhealthy system -- a system based on an essentially unhealthy paradigm? It argues, successfully, that the paradigm which creates addiction can't also heal it; in other words, there is no solution for our social ills short of fundamental whole-system change. The first step is to face our taboos and our toxic patterns with honesty and integrity. The book is a powerful wake-up call."<br>--Willis Harman, former president, Institute of Noetic Sciences, Sausalito, California </p><p>"This book is a must-read for anyone who values family and freedom."<br>--Russell Means, activist, actor, and co-author of <i>Where White Men Fear to Tread.</i></p></blockquote> <p><b></b>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Denise Brenton and Chris Largent, a wife-husband writing and teaching team, have done freelance teaching in colleges and universities for over twenty years, focusing on philosophy and comparative religion.

A homeless man who called himself Billy Blake is found dead of starvation in the garage of an expensive home near London's Thames, and it looks as though he might be a merchant banker who disappeared in 1988 with 10 million pounds. A magazine journalist named Michael Deacon is intrigued by the case and by the missing banker's wife and soon finds that there are much darker overtones to both. Other Walters books in paperback include <i>The Ice House</i>, <i>The Scold's Bridle</i>.<i>"It was the smell that Mrs. Powell noticed first. Slightly sweet. Slightly unpleasant</i>...<i>It shocked her badly to find a dead man in the corner, his head slumped on his knees."<br></i><br>When Billy Blake, a homeless alcoholic, is found dead of starvation in Amanda Powell's private garage in the ritzy docklands area of London, the press arrives in force. But Billy's story is never told because Amanda refuses to comment, and interest in the unknown wino quickly flags.<p>Then, six months after Blake's death, the journalist Michael Deacon discovers that Amanda has changed her tune. Now she is suddenly eager to talk about Billy for Deacon's feature article on poverty and the homeless. More than eager &#x2013; she seems obsessed with finding out the real identity of her dead visitor. Deacon's curiosity is piqued. Why is Amanda taking Blake's death so personally? Why did he choose her garage to die in? And why is she so anxious to discover his true identity?</p><p>The more he learns about Blake, the more Deacon can sense echoes of the homeless man's life in his own. Echoes so compelling that Deacon can't let go of the story until he's learned who Billy Blake really was &#x2013; and why Amanda is almost certainly lying about her own interest in the dead man.</p></p><h2>White: The Great Pursuit (The Circle Trilogy Graphic Novels, Book 3)</h2><p>The fate of two worlds hangs in the balance of one man&#39;s choices--an unlikely hero who may not survive the next 24 hours.

He's made three films about the war and its aftermath: <i>Platoon,</i> <i>Born on the Fourth of July,</i> and <i>Heaven and Earth;</i> now he has also penned a novel that skirts the borders of autobiography--the hero, after all, is called Oliver. The novel grew out of three major experiences in young Oliver's life: his time as a civilian teacher in a Saigon Catholic school, his return to America aboard a merchant marine ship, and his eventual return to Vietnam as a soldier. <p> Stone originally wrote this novel in 1966 at the age of 19. In a fit of frustration and despair after numerous rejections from publishers, Stone "threw several sections of the manuscript into the East River one cold night, and, as if surgically removing the memory of the book from my mind, volunteered for the Vietnam of 1967." For many years, the remaining sections of the manuscript lay forgotten in a shoebox, until eventually Stone recovered them, rewrote the novel, and published it this year.</p><p><b>Oliver Stone</b> lives in Los Angeles.</p></p><h2>Art Now!

Mary Lucille had raised all of her children on a plumber's salary and was known for feeding the neighborhood kids as well. She was the best cook in all of Hamilton County. It was more than just a rumor that Grandmother Griffin's red velvet cake could make a Baptist get up and dance. </p><p> When poor Mary Lucille was practically on her deathbed, my mother decided that it would be a shame for all those wonderful recipes to go with her. My grandmother, like most Southern cooks of her era, cooked without any written recipes. It was a pinch of this and a little of that. I know, because out of all the grandkids I was the only one who took a real interest in the way she cooked. I would follow beside her in the kitchen as she whirled about in her flour-covered apron, making her delicious tea cakes. </p><p> My mother decided that it was up to us to get all those recipes on paper. So off we went to Grandmother's house with my Big Chief tablet in hand. Mary Lucille was trying to nap, but my mother was not to be deterred. She gently poked her and whispered, "Mama? About your biscuits?" </p><p> "What?" Mary Lucille asked, without opening her eyes. </p><p> "Leslie Allen and I are going to write down the recipe for your biscuits." </p><p> "Oh Lord, Peggy Ann, do we have to do it now? I wanted to rest a little before my stories come on." </p><p> Mary Lucille's "stories" were her beloved soap operas. She watched them every afternoon without fail. One time we went to her house and the television was off. She was in bed during her stories and got us all worried. Granddaddy Griffin explained that Lynette had been framed and was in jail. She'd just found out she was pregnant with Hawk's baby. Poor Lynette was going to have the baby behind bars. It had upset my grandmother so much she had to take to the bed. We thought he was talking about some of our trashy relatives, but it turned out Lynette was the heroine of Mary Lucille's soap opera. </p><p> My mother persisted. "It's now or never. How much flour, Mama?" </p><p> Mary Lucille thought for a while, then opened her eyes. "Well, let me see. Enough to make a nest." </p><p> "Make a nest? That doesn't make sense." </p><p> "I know what she means," I piped in. "You pour enough fl our in the bowl to pat it out and then it looks like a nest." </p><p> "Well, all right. Write that down. How much shortening, Mama?" </p><p> As I scribbled in my Big Chief tablet, Mary Lucille held up two shaky fingers, then promptly rolled over and went right back to sleep. </p><p> My mother sat there looking befuddled. </p><p> "I know what she means," I said again. "She means you take your two fingers and scrape them into the Crisco. And that's how much shortening you plop in the bowl." </p><p> "Well, Lord help us all, we can't write that down." </p><p> So our little project came to a disappointing end. </p><p> I get most of my sense of humor from my Granddaddy Griffin. Homer Howard Griffin was a stitch until the day they put him in his grave. Even in his nineties he had the nurses at the hospital eating out of his hand because of his amazing sense of humor. He liked to talk a little dirty, much to the delight of us grandkids. And Lord knows, with eight children there were a lot of grandkids. </p><p> One time, he was cutting up at the dinner table, and my favorite aunt Dot said, "Daddy, when you talk like that in front of the children it makes my skin crawl." </p><p> Granddaddy Griffin cocked his head inquisitively and said, "Well, Dot, what does your <i>heinie</i> smell like when it crawls past your <i>face</i>?" </p><p> All of us kids just hollered. </p><p> When Grandaddy died, I was performing with a melodrama troupe in Bakersfield, California. It was my first acting job after college and I was in heaven. I was making $165 a week! My mother called and tearfully told me, "Your biggest fan passed on this morning." </p><p> And he was. He really was my biggest fan. Even toward the end, when he was crazy as a bedbug and did not recognize anyone else, I would walk in the room and he'd say, "Leslie Allen, can you help spring me out of here?" </p><p> I had other fans from the beginning. When I was little, I think both Peggy Ann and Mary Lucille took one look at me and thought, <i>He's going to need some help!</i> </p><p> They circled the wagons, as only true Southern women can do, and created a secret garden where it was okay for little boys to play with dolls. How sweet is that? It was also okay for little boys to read about Trixie Belden and Nancy Drew instead of those rambunctious Hardy Boys. And it was okay for little boys to make potholders and sew doll clothes. I was "artistic," and they encouraged me in that arena. But somehow, even at a young age, I knew it was best to not let Daddy into our little secret garden. So even though I was allowed to do what I wanted, I knew it was somehow shameful. </p><p> My daddy, Allen Bernard Jordan, was a man's man. He was as handsome as a movie star. Even though he stood a little less than five feet five, he was in possession of an easy kind of masculinity that both awes and terrifi es me -- and that I am extremely attracted to. I've been in therapy about <i>that</i> for years. </p><p> My daddy used to call me "son" as if he was in deep pain. He'd say, "Oh, son," and it would sound like "sohhhn." </p><p> One of my early ambitions was to be a go-go dancer. I used to sit and watch the dancers on a TV show called <i>Hullabaloo</i>, which was the MTV of my generation. I was transfixed as the dancers wildly cavorted on white platforms. I knew it took a lot of practice to achieve that level of expertise, so I pushed all the furniture in the living room out of the way and commandeered the coffee table. Once I had mastered "the Jerk," I moved on to the next level, which included "the Swim" and "the Hitchhiker." After several weeks of intense practice, I also had "the Batman" and "Mashed Potato" under my belt. By the time my repertoire included "the Dirty Dog," which involved a whole lot of hunching and some really intricate facial expressions, I was on my way. </p><p> My poor daddy would come home and his firstborn son would be feverishly go-go dancing on the coffee table to "Wipeout" by the Safaris. </p><p> "Daddy, watch me do the Pony!" I'd squeal as I hopped from foot to foot, jerking my head back and forth. </p><p> "Oh, <i>son</i>," he'd sigh. </p><p> My career hopes were dashed when I noticed that one of the boy dancers on <i>Hullabaloo</i> had bleached bangs. This was before even the Beach Boys had bleached bangs, and I thought that was the coolest thing I had ever seen. I talked my friend Charlie into helping me achieve my new look. We took hydrogen peroxide and combed it through my bangs, which promptly turned bright orange. When confronted by my daddy at the dinner table, I swore right over my Chef Boyardee ravioli that I didn't know what had happened. I just woke up that morning and there it was. Orange bangs. Can you believe it? </p><p> He did not believe it. </p><p> I got a good whipping for that. Not because I bleached my hair but because I lied. The whipping apparently did not do a lick of good, since when I was growing up I could lie with the greatest of ease. I have been in therapy about this, too. </p><p> Anyway, it was so disheartening. If I couldn't even get away with bleached bangs, how on earth was I ever, ever going to get away with high-heeled, pointy-toed Italian boots and skintight, striped pencil pants? </p><p> So I gave up my dream of becoming a go-go dancer and replaced it with dreams of becoming a majorette. My mother had been a majorette in high school (aren't they all in Tennessee?). I pulled out her baton one sweltering summer afternoon and begged her to show me a routine. I had always been fascinated with batons. My daddy had once taken me to a football game and tried patiently to explain all the ins and outs of football. </p><p> "Now, son, that is the offense and that is the defense." </p><p> I tugged on his sleeve and asked impatiently, </p><p> "Daddy, when do the majorettes come out?" </p><p> "Oh, <i>son</i>..." </p><p> On that summer afternoon, Mother showed me a few of her best moves and that was all it took. I began to practice with a vengeance. I was in the front yard going to town with my baton when my daddy pulled up with his army buddies in tow. </p><p> "Daddy! Daddy! Watch me twirl!" I yelled in my high, squeaky voice. </p><p> "Oh, son," he lamented, pulling me aside, away from the pitying eyes of his buddies. "Why don't you twirl that little baton in the house?" </p><p> "Mama's afraid I'll break something!" I threw the baton over my head, did a big final twirl, and caught it in a pose. I wanted to show those big, butch army boys a thing or two. </p><p> "Son, I'll pay for whatever you break! Just please twirl in the house." Now, don't get me wrong. My daddy was a good man. I adored my daddy.

He lives in Fayetteville, Tennessee.<br><br>Chapter One<br>Cass Wakefield was born in a double-pen log cabin just at break of day, and before he was twenty minutes old, he was almost thrown out with the bedclothes. The midwife, Queenolia Divine, heard him squalling, however, and so it was that Cass, blue-faced and complaining, was untangled from the wad of bloody sheets and saved for further adventures.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first light he saw fell on the northeast corner of Yalobusha County, Mississippi, in a cleared place among ancient oaks and hickories and sweetgums called Lost Camp. By the time Cass was born, the frontier had passed the village by, and the westerly road was busy with travelers. Ox-drawn wagons filled with bewildered women and children groaned and creaked through the settlement, the men riding beside with long rifles laid across their saddle bows. Soon Texas beckoned with the Possibility that always burns so bright over a revolution. Captain David Sansing--he was not a real captain, but he seemed like one, so that is what they called him--left early, invited by Sam Houston himself to join the fray. The balance of the Lost Camp men--including Cass's daddy, John, and his uncle Estes Burke, and the elder Wakefield brothers, Augustus and Rome--formed a company, twenty-three men, which they called the Yalobusha Yellow Jackets. With a retinue of Negroes for the camp chores, they rode away to fight for Texas independence, promising to return in glory with land grants that would make them rich. As it turned out, they never returned at all. They got lost on the way, and six of them died of fever before they got out of Arkansas. The rest found Texas finally, but before they could lift a hand in its defense, the Mexicans captured them and shot every one, even the Negroes, at Goliad in '36.<br>&nbsp;<br>Months later, the Memphis post-rider appeared in Lost Camp accompanied by a wagon. In the bed was a wooden crate bound with tin straps and tight as a cedar skiff, lettered "General Delivery, Lost Camp, Yalobusha County, Mississippi." The post-rider was in a bad humor, for the box swarmed with flies and sugar-bees and had a musky smell about it. The women and children and old men gathered about under the oaks, and it was decided to let the post-rider open the box in the presence of them all. The man's crowbar grated as he prized at the lid.<br>&nbsp;<br>All his life to come, Cass could remember the smell that burst from the opened box when the lid fell off. The people lurched back, and some of them ran away. The women set up a keening, grabbing at one another, at their children. One went mad on the spot--they were never far from madness anyhow. The old men, after a while, laid them out in the sun: twenty-two yellow roundabouts trimmed in red, smeared with blood, and punctured with ragged, smoke-rimmed holes where the musket balls had entered, then left again on the other side.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cass's mother, Prudence, recognized the stitching in the jackets she had made. She sat in the dust, took one up, and pressed it to her face while Cass stood by, trying to understand what it all meant. Prudence, her eyes dry, her voice steady, made it plain to him. She said, "Your father is dead, and your uncle Estes, and Rome, and Augustus." Cass knelt beside her, in the hot dust that swarmed with fleas, and spoke in the language he had learned early from the men. "I will see to it, Ma," he said. "I will find them who did this, and you will have your--" But he never finished, for Prudence slapped him hard across the mouth, another lesson learned, then drew him to her hard and held him and the jacket both so close that Cass lost his breath and could not have cried had he wanted to.<br>&nbsp;<br>At first, no one could imagine who had done this thing, and all wondered what happened to the twenty-third jacket. Certain ones began to look to Estes Burke.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cousin Sally Mae Burke was the first girl Cass ever fell in love with, and the first, but not the last, to discourage him. Sally Mae's mother, Diana Maria Velez, was a Spanish woman who gave her daughter eyes and hair and skin that might have suggested Mediterranean twilights to the Lost Camp lads, had they known of such. Sally Mae Burke strode among her pale Anglo-Saxon neighbors, tossing her black hair, scorning the boys, especially Cass, and igniting the girls with jealousy--teaching them all (and quick they learned, and early, for life was often short) what it meant to be beautiful. Many were the miniature fights Cass Wakefield fought to defend his cousin against boys who loved her, were rejected, and thus grew bitter in their learning. "Nigger girl" they called her, and "Greaser," and other things, while the girls, learning their own ways, shut her out with cold silence.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the hot afternoon when the jackets came, the people of Lost Camp forgot, if they ever knew, the distinction between Spanish and Mexican. A single thought, born of whispers by night, ran through the settlement.<br>&nbsp;<br>Next morning, just after daylight, a crowd of women stormed up the road to the Burke cabin. It was a mob of despair, all the women red-eyed from crying, their hair in disarray, some with suckling babes, intent to revenge themselves on the Mexican. The madwoman came tottering behind, tearing at her hair, her mouth a dark oval. Prudence Wakefield counseled reason and was shouted down. Annie Frye counseled reason, but she had lost no one and so was scorned to shame. Cass Wakefield ran beside the column, among the packs of barking dogs; he cried for his cousin, pulled at the women's faded dresses, at last was cuffed into the roadside ditch by a hand that might have petted him once. Young Alison Sansing, toting her baby brother, discovered Cass there. They held tight to one another and wept while Perry squalled for milk.<br>&nbsp;<br>The women found voice in the yard. Prudence and Annie moved among them, pleading, touching hands and faces, all futile, for someone had to carry the blame. The women shook their fists, held up their infants in accusation, cried terrible things from throats grown raw with weeping. They cried foolishness, how Burke was spared because he had married a Greaser. His was the lost jacket, they cried. He was a coward and betrayed the rest, they cried, for this was what had come to their minds as reason. They shouted until their voices were harsh, but received only silence in return. The cabin was empty; Diana Maria Velez, with the foresight common to those who are different, had vanished with her daughter in the night. The women burned the cabin anyway.<br>&nbsp;<br>No glory or riches, then, for the widows and orphans of Old Yalobusha, nor even anyone to bury among the cedars. They learned months later, by home-traveling men, that the Mexicans had burned all the bodies, including Estes Burke's, way out yonder in the Land of Promise.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Cass's mother went to work at Frye's Tavern, cooking and cleaning and serving meals to the people filling up the new country, who came with slaves and cottonseed to make riches in the Leaf River bottoms. Times were flush then, and Lost Camp became a Land of Promise all its own. Meanwhile, the widows married again, and new ground was cleared at such a rate that, in a few years, a tree was hard to find anywhere but along Leaf River or in the cemetery.<br>&nbsp;<br>Prudence Wakefield did not marry. She scorned her few suitors, who were tubercular or crippled anyhow and could find no prospects among the more robust women. In any event, Prudence and all her suitors, and a good many wormy children and broken-down old people, were struck by the scarlet fever of '44, as if Providence had decided to tidy up the place once and for all.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fever came in a warm November, a season of drizzling rain, low clouds, deep mud, when the sun, the moon, the stars seemed to have deserted the heavens. The prosperous holed up on their farms, where they died just the same, or fled north into Tennessee. Smudge fires burned day and night on the square, blanketing the town in a dingy gray pall meant to drive the miasma away. The Presbyterians owned the only bell, and it tolled constantly to keep the atmospheres stirred. Every day, droves of blackbirds came from their roosts along Leaf River, and more crows than anyone could remember. Dogs roamed the deserted streets, licking at the mud, and the wheels of the dead-cart creaked through the nights.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cass's mother lay dying in a room above the tavern. All the boarders had fled, and the place groaned with emptiness. Only Mister Frye and his wife remained, and their black girl, Queenolia Divine, who changed the sheets and emptied the bedpan until only gravelly vomit was left to empty. Miz Annie Frye did the cooking right on the hearth, spooning broth between Prudence Wakefield's cracked lips, around her swollen tongue.<br>&nbsp;<br>Once, Prudence said, "Leave. It will come on you, too, if you don't. Take the lad and go."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why, Prudy," said Mister Frye, "you don't really want that, do you?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"No," she said. Her eyes were hot and glittering. "I can't stand the thought of bein' alone."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Then don't think it," said Mister Frye.<br>&nbsp;<br>So they stayed, all of them, in the close loft smelling of bile and wood smoke, and of their own bodies, while the rain hammered at the shutters. The clocks had long since wound down, and Mister Frye did not bother to wind his watch, so time was only light and dark, passing almost imperceptibly, one to another. By night, Miz Frye read Psalms aloud by candlelight, but only the pretty ones, and over and over again the story of the woman at Jacob's well, for Prudence loved to hear about the living water and the dauncy girl with all her husbands.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, Cass sat by his mother's bed, bathing her face or listening to her voice ramble through other times, among people he did not know. Now and then, she clutched his hand tight, her eyes moving, watching some shadow pass before her. "I am so sorry," she would say to someone in the shadow. "I am so sorry." At such times she wept.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes, when she was sleeping, Cass left the tavern and wandered along Town Creek, going down to where it joined the little river Leaf. The living water went its way, slow and indifferent; only the birds seemed interested in his passage. He felt aloneness like a physical pain, and now and then he would call on God to see if He was anywhere around. No answer ever came that he could tell.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the last day of Prudence Wakefield's life, a minister came by: a little round man with half-spectacles who rode the Hardshell Baptist circuit. The regular Baptist man was gone off somewhere, the Methodist and Presbyterian shepherds were dead, and the mission priest had yielded up the ghost among his scattered flock down on the Natchez Trace. So here was the circuit rider in his muddy boots and clothes, come to ease the soul of the dying woman.<br>&nbsp;<br>Evening was coming on, and the gloom in the loft was thick, even with a candle burning. The minister took the dying woman's hand. "Sister," he said kindly, "what's on your heart?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"I am grievin'," said Prudence, her voice no louder than the hissing of the fire. "I am afeard. I have not done well in most things. I want to . . . make confession."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Open your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ," said the minister. "Bring your sins to Him."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I done that," said Prudence.<br>&nbsp;<br>"And what did He tell ye?" asked the minister.<br>&nbsp;<br>The dying woman thought a moment. "I . . . well, never nothin' in words. But you can say 'em. I want to hear you say 'em."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I can't speak for the Lord," said the man.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes, you can," said Prudence. "I want . . . I want you to tell me I am goin' to heaven."<br>&nbsp;<br>The minister leaned forward in his chair. "Well, Sister, have ye been . . . bip-tized?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"A long time ago," said Prudence. "By the old church in Albemarle."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Ah," said the minister. He laid her hand back on the counterpane and leaned back in his chair. "Romish?" he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"English," said Prudence.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The same," said the minister. "Sprinkled, I reckon?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"That was our custom," said Prudence.<br>&nbsp;<br>The minister leaned forward in his chair once more. "Well, that is the custom of false teachers," he said. "Ye must be bip-tized in the way of Jesus. Ye must be buried and raised agin."<br>&nbsp;<br>Cass began, "She told you once already--" but Mister Frye laid a hand on his shoulder.<br>&nbsp;<br>The minister said, "Woman, will ye be bip-tized in the way?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Prudence Wakefield's eyes were bright with fever, and a little flame of her fear leaped up in them. "It says once is enough," she whispered.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It says true," answered the minister.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I fear goin' down in the cold river."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Then I can make no promises," said the minister. He stood up then, scraping the chair back. "Hit's a narrow gate," he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Now, wait a minute," said Prudence. She held out her hand; it trembled in the space between them. "You promise me I'll go to heaven. You say it!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"I won't say it. I can't say it. 'Less you be bip-tized in the way of the Lord Jesus Christ--"<br>&nbsp;<br>Cass shook off Mister Frye's hand and moved against the minister. He closed his hand on the man's sleeve. "My ma is afeared," he said. "You tell her."<br>&nbsp;<br>The man shook his head sadly. He looked at Prudence. "You best get your heart right," he said. "You best get ready. Hit's a long time in hell."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Get out, sir," said Mister Frye.<br>&nbsp;<br>The minister shook his head again and looked at them all. Then he was gone, clumping downstairs in his muddy boots.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Don't you be worryin', Prudy," said Annie Frye. She took the dying woman's hand. "We'll all meet by the river one day and listen to the angels sing."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well, I don't know," said Prudence. "I don't know."<br>&nbsp;<br>Cass left the tavern and walked blindly through the foul, smoky afternoon until he came to the river. He could hear the trees rattling and the soft chuckle of the water as it moved over a tangle of fallen logs. He looked up at the yellow sky smeared by a ribbon of smoke or cloud. "Is that the best You can do?" the boy said. "Ain't it enough You are takin' her? You had to send that man to punish her too? What did she ever do to You?" He listened, but of course no answer came. "What did she ever do to You!" he cried, but heard only his own voice echoing off the clay bluff.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That night, Cass woke from a troublesome dream. He had been among some trees by a dark shore, where a great bird visited him. He could hear it coming a long way off, then all at once it lit high in a spindly oak. There it stirred, restless, a black shape among the branches. Cass woke with the rustling of the bird in his ears. The room was hot, the window a pale square of starlit clouds. The fire was licking at a new log and made a dancing light on the walls.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Ma?" said Cass. He listened, but no sound came from the bed. He understood then. He could not imagine God, but Death was another matter. Death was always in evidence among them; he had a smell, a substance, that followed him. Cass knew he had been here, had passed his wing over Pruden...</p><h2>Know your Bernina (Creative machine arts series)</h2><p>super book that can be used with Berninas or other sewing machines.

Scott Fitzgerald's 1934 Tender is the Night was his last and most painfully conceived novel. Based on personal experience (the schizophrenia of his wife, Zelda, his affair with a Hollywood actress and the time they spent in Paris, Switzerland and on the Cote d'Azur), it is a sad but hauntingly beautiful exploration of the way in which a needy person leaches the spirit out of a strong one.

A prominent participant throughout the conflict, Hood wrote an account of enduring importance for readers interested in Civil War military campaigns or postwar controversies among former Confederates."--Gary W. Gallagher</b><br><br>When John Bell Hood entered into the services of the Confederate Army, he was 29 years old, a handsome man and courageous soldier, loyal to the ideal of Confederate Independence and eager to fight for it. He led his men bravely into the battles of Second Manassas, Gaines's Mill, Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga. He rose fast, attaining the temporary rank of full general, only to fall faster. Hood emerged from the war with his left arm shattered and useless, his right leg missing, his face aged far beyond his 33 years, and with his military reputation in disgrace. <br><br>Blamed by contemporaries for contributing to the defeat of his beloved Confederacy, Hood struggled to refute their accusations. His most vehement critic, General Johnston, charged Hood with insubordination while serving under him and, after succeeding him in command, of recklessly leading Confederate troops to their "slaughter" and "useless butchery." Sherman, too, in his <i>Memoirs, </i>took a harsh view of Hood. <br><br>Born of controversy, <i>Advance and Retreat</i> is of course a highly controversial book. It is also full of invaluable information and insights into the retreat from Dalton in early 1864, the fighting around Atlanta, and the disastrous Tennessee Campaign in winter of that year. Far from being a careful, sober, objective account, this book is the passionate, bitter attempt of a soldier to rebut history's judgment of himself as general and man.<br><i>With an introduction by Richard M.

The line work is rough and has a certain degree of shapelessness, which works well with the nature scenes and the watercolors themselves, but which makes the characters occasionally seem clumsy. Where it works exceptionally well, however, is in the depiction of Ursa's rage-induced visions and the magical realism of Rafi's journey to the U.S., where policemen ride pigs and he has to climb over St. Peter's Gate to cross the border. Also compelling are the author's tone-clear rendition of Rafi's broken English and the strangeness of the protagonists' decisions. The atmospheric tone of the medium and the setting, combined with the weirdness of the characters' actions and their hallucinatory impressions, creates a curious, open-ended, and emotional reading experience.<i>&#x2013;Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their final voyage, led by Freydis Eiriksdottir, the enigmatic daughter of the renegade Eirik the Red, is shrouded in mystery. Of the two ships that set out from Greenland in search of Vinland, why did only one ship return from the fabled new-found land? And what kind of a leader was Freydis? Was she brave and resourceful? Or was she, as the sagas claim, vengeful and cruel? Epic in scope, Eiriksdottir presents a complex northern world in which greed and desire, dreams and luck are intertwined.

When i was treated at the scene, the husky EMT said flatly, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a lot worse off than you.&#x201d; The police officer had to remove my handcuffs; he snapped on latex gloves to avoid having to touch my burned palms and wrists.</p><p>They drove me in a squad car to the East Hampton station house for booking, and finally into the sheriff&#x2019;s van for the ride here to the county jail, fifteen miles away in Mashomuck.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll tell you one detail because it&#x2019;s frozen in my mind. The phrase &#x201c;two to the head.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve been hearing since the police arrived. &#x201c;She gave him two to the head.&#x201d; Then they laugh at me. it&#x2019;s supposed to be a big joke about how inept Ii was.</p><p>This enormous, shaved-head bodybuilding sheriff acted it out for me in the van on the way here. &#x201c;One,&#x201d; he said, pretending to clobber the other sheriff over the head. &#x201c;Two.&#x201d; He imitated the second blow. Then, &#x201c;Ouch,&#x201d; he said as he waggled his fingers at me and winked nastily at my bandaged hands. &#x201c;You burned yourself as bad as you hurt him, but he&#x2019;s going to the hospital and you&#x2019;re going to jail.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d like to block his words out. They make this seem like any other crime, one of the salacious stories you see on CNN Headline news. To the outside i suppose all crimes are the same&#x2014;someone attacks, another is injured. It&#x2019;s only in a person&#x2019;s mind and heart, only within the soul of any given family that the entire tender, brutal, surreal story makes any sense.</p><p>I say &#x201c;family,&#x201d; but it might only be me. i have three blood relatives in this world: Anne, my older and only sister, and her children, a niece and nephew i barely know because her husband has cut us off so thoroughly. Blood is one thing, but to be family, you need so much more.</p><p>This morning I&#x2019;d reached my breaking point on that and taken the LIRR out east, unannounced, to show up with roses for Anne and books and Valentines for the kids. I chose late morning, when Frederik would be at his gallery. The day was bright blue but frigid, no humidity, a sharp wind whirling around Montauk Point.</p><p>i caught a cab from the station to their house on Old Montauk Highway. I was a wreck, thinking she&#x2019;d slam the door in my face. But she didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;she let me in. Right now I can hardly stand the memory of seeing the shock and joy in her eyes, feeling our strong embrace, as if our lives in that instant had been reset, back to the time before him.</p><p>The children didn&#x2019;t know who I was. They&#x2019;re only three and five, and I last saw them all at my mother&#x2019;s funeral a year ago, when Frederik had dragged the family away from the gravesite before Anne and I had a chance to console each other, or even speak.</p><p>For twenty minutes today we had a good time. The house was freezing; obviously the heat was turned way down. Anne, Gillis (&#x201c;Gilly&#x201d;), and Margarita (&#x201c;Grit&#x201d;) wore warm shirts and fleece pullovers. I kept my jacket on. We huddled around the hearth where two logs sparked with a dull glow; a third had barely caught, flames just licking the top edge.</p><p>The brass screen had been set aside, as if to keep the wire mesh from holding back the fading warmth. I glanced around for a poker, but saw nothing to stoke the fire. There didn&#x2019;t seem to be any more wood either.</p><p>I was afraid to ask about the heat, or lack of it. Anything can trigger Anne, especially when it comes to Frederik. She might have taken my question as implied criticism of his ability or willingness to provide basic needs for his family. She&#x2019;s very defensive about him. But the truth is, she&#x2019;s always had a strange, secret side when it came to men. She puts them on pedestals, and then subverts them in ways they&#x2019;d never guess.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll confess something else: Anne and i had probably been the closest sisters on earth, but we have never been completely, one-hundred-percent easy with each other. i don&#x2019;t believe Anne can be that way with anyone.</p></p><h2>Spotlight on Charity</h2><p>Risky Rat attempts to ruin the Churchmouse choir performance by encouraging Charity to be selfish and take the solo for herself.</p><p></p><h2>Hollywood Shack Job: Rock Music in Film and on Your Screen (Counterculture Series)</h2><p><p>"I thought a book needed to be written about the music, especially the rock 'n' roll, we hear on the screen and collect as soundtrack albums; the interaction of the music and the cinematography clicking together like a Motown rhythm section; the story of how the music gets inside the films, and how rock 'n' roll in particular has been utilized in television the last six decades."--from <i>Hollywood Shack Job</i></p><p>For over thirty years Harvey Kubernik has been actively involved in the music scene in Los Angeles as a studio musician, record producer, and reporter.

The waves that were a bright, hard blue yesterday under a fading sky today are green, opaque, and cold. If you are a boy not wanted in the house you walk the beach for hours, feeling the winter that has come in the night; sand blowing across your shoes, spray wetting the legs of your corduroys. You turn your back to the sea, and with the sharp end of a stick found half buried write in the wet sand <em>Tackman Babcock.</em><br>Then you go home, knowing that behind you the Atlantic is destroying your work.<br>Home is the big house on Settlers Island, but Settlers Island, so called, is not really an island and for that reason is not named or accurately delineated on maps. Smash a barnacle with a stone and you will see inside the shape from which the beautiful barnacle goose takes its name. There is a thin and flaccid organ which is the goose&#x2019;s neck and the mollusc&#x2019;s siphon, and a shapeless body with tiny wings. Settlers Island is like that.<br>The goose neck is a strip of land down which a county road runs. By whim, the mapmakers usually exaggerate the width of this and give no information to indicate that it is scarcely above the high tide. Thus Settlers Island appears to be a mere protuberance on the coast, not requiring a name&#x2014;and since the village of eight or ten houses has none, nothing shows on the map but the spider line of road terminating at the sea.<br>The village has no name, but home has two: a near and a far designation. On the island, and on the mainland nearby, it is called the Seaview place because in the earliest years of the century it was operated as a resort hotel. Mama calls it The House of 31 February; and that is on her stationery and is presumably used by her friends in New York and Philadelphia when they do not simply say, "Mrs. Babcock&#x2019;s." Home is four floors high in some places, less in others, and is completely surrounded by a veranda; it was once painted yellow, but the paint&#x2014;outside&#x2014;is mostly gone now and The House of 31 February is grey.<br>Jason comes out the front door with the little curly hairs on his chin trembling in the wind and his thumbs hooked in the waistband of his Levi&#x2019;s. "Come on, you&#x2019;re going into town with me. Your mother wants to rest."<br>"Hey tough!" Into Jason&#x2019;s Jaguar, feeling the leather upholstery soft and smelly; you fall asleep.<br>Awake in town, bright lights flashing in the car windows. Jason is gone and the car is growing cold; you wait for what seems a long time, looking out at the shop windows, the big gun on the hip of the policeman who walks past, the lost dog who is afraid of everyone, even you when you tap the glass and call to him.<br>Then Jason is back with packages to put behind the seat. "Are we going home now?"<br>He nods without looking at you, arranging his bundles so they won&#x2019;t topple over, fastening his seatbelt.<br>"I want to get out of the car."<br>He looks at you.<br>"I want to go in a store. Come on, Jason."<br>Jason sighs. "All right, the drugstore over there, okay? Just for a minute."<br>The drugstore is as big as a supermarket, with long, bright aisles of glassware and notions and paper goods. Jason buys fluid for his lighter at the cigarette counter, and you bring him a book from a revolving wire rack. "Please, Jason?"<br>He takes it from you and replaces it in the rack, then when you are in the car again takes it from under his jacket and gives it to you.<br>It is a wonderful book, thick and heavy, with the edges of the pages tinted yellow. The covers are glossy stiff cardboard, and on the front is a picture of a man in rags fighting a thing partly like an ape and partly like a man, but much worse than either. The picture is in color, and there is real blood on the ape-thing; the man is muscular and handsome, with tawny hair lighter than Jason&#x2019;s and no beard.<br>"You like that?"<br>You are out of town already, and without the street lights it&#x2019;s too dark in the car, almost, to see the picture. You nod.<br>Jason laughs. "That&#x2019;s camp. Did you know that?"<br>You shrug, riffling the pages under your thumb, thinking of reading, alone, in your room tonight.<br>"You going to tell your mom how nice I was to you?"<br>"Uh-huh, sure. You want me to?"<br>"Tomorrow, not tonight. I think she&#x2019;ll be asleep when we get back. Don&#x2019;t you wake her up." Jason&#x2019;s voice says he will be angry if you do.<br>"Okay."<br>"Don&#x2019;t come in her room."<br>"Okay."<br>The Jaguar says "<em>Hutntntaaa..." down the road, and you can see the whitecaps in the moonlight now, and the driftwood pushed just off the asphalt.</em><br>"You got a nice, soft mommy, you know that? When I climb on her it&#x2019;s just like being on a big pillow."<br>You nod, remembering the times when, lonely and frightened by dreams, you have crawled into her bed and snuggled against her soft warmth&#x2014;but at the same time angry, knowing Jason is somehow deriding you both.<br>Home is silent and dark, and you leave Jason as soon as you can, bounding off down the hall and up the stairs ahead of him, up a second, narrow, twisted flight to your own room in the turret.<br>***<br>I had this story from a man who was breaking his word in telling it. How much it has suffered in his hands&#x2014;I should say in his mouth, rather&#x2014;I cannot say. In essentials it is true, and I give it to you as it was given to me. This is the story he told.<br>Captain Phillip Ransom had been adrift, alone, for nine days when he saw the island. It was already late evening when it appeared like a thin line of purple on the horizon, but Ransom did not sleep that night. There was no feeble questioning in his wakeful mind concerning the reality of what he had seen; he had been given that one glimpse and he knew. Instead his brain teemed with facts and speculations. He knew he must be somewhere near New Guinea, and he reviewed mentally what he knew of the currents in these waters and what he had learned in the past nine days of the behavior of his raft. The island when he reached it&#x2014;he did not allow himself to <em>if&#x2014;would in all probability be solid jungle a few feet back from the water&#x2019;s edge. There might or might not be natives, but he brought to mind all he could of the Bazaar Malay and Tagalog he had acquired in his years as a pilot, plantation manager, white hunter, and professional fighting man in the Pacific.</em><br>In the morning he saw that purple shadow on the horizon again, a little nearer this time and almost precisely where his mental calculations had told him to expect it. For nine days there had been no reason to employ the inadequate paddles provided with the raft, but now he had something to row for. Ransom drank the last of his water and began stroking with a steady and powerful beat which was not interrupted until the prow of his rubber craft ground into beach sand.<br>***<br>Morning.

In the muffled silence the city seemed bewildered, like a man whose sight has suddenly failed. People vague as invalids groped their way through the murk, keeping close to the house fronts and the railings and stopping tentatively at street corners to feel with a wary foot for the pavement's edge. Motorcars with their headlights on loomed like giant insects, trailing milky dribbles of exhaust smoke from their rear ends. The evening paper listed each day's toll of mishaps. There had been a serious collision at the canal end of the Rathgar Road involving three cars and an army motorcyclist. A small boy was run over by a coal lorry at the Five Lamps, but did not die&nbsp;his mother swore to the reporter sent to interview her that it was the miraculous medal of the Virgin Mary she made the child wear round his neck that had saved him. In Clanbrassil Street an old moneylender was waylaid and robbed in broad daylight by what he claimed was a gang of house wives; the Guards were following a definite line of inquiry. A shawlie in Moore Street was knocked down by a van that did not stop, and now the woman was in a coma in St. James's. And all day long the foghorns boomed out in the bay. </p><p>Phoebe Griffin considered herself April's best friend, but she had heard nothing from her in a week and she was convinced something had happened. She did not know what to do. Of course, April might just have gone off, without telling anyone&nbsp; that was how April was, unconventional, some would say wild&nbsp; but Phoebe was sure that was not the case. </p><p>The windows of April's first-floor flat on Herbert Place had a blank, withholding aspect, not just because of the fog: windows look like that when the rooms behind them are empty; Phoebe could not say how, but they do. She crossed to the other side of the road and stood at the railings with the canal at her back and looked up at the terrace of tall houses, their lowering, dark brick exteriors shining wetly in the shrouded air. She was not sure what she was hoping to see&nbsp; a curtain twitching, a face at a window?&nbsp; but there was nothing, and no one. The damp was seeping through her clothes, and she drew in her shoulders against the cold. She heard footsteps on the towpath behind her, but when she turned to look she could not see anyone through the impenetrable, hanging grayness. The bare trees with their black limbs upflung appeared almost human. The unseen walker coughed once; it sounded like a fox barking. </p><p>She went back and climbed the stone steps to the door again, and again pressed the bell above the little card with April's name on it, though she knew there would be no answer. Grains of mica glittered in the granite of the steps; strange, these little secret gleamings, under the fog. A ripping whine started up in the sawmill on the other side of the canal and she realized that what she had been smelling without knowing it was the scent of freshly cut timber. </p><p>She walked up to Baggot Street and turned right, away from the canal. The heels of her fl at shoes made a deadened tapping on the pavement. It was lunchtime on a weekday but it felt more like a Sunday twilight. The city seemed almost deserted, and the few people she met flickered past sinisterly, like phantoms. She was reasoning with herself. The fact that she had not seen or heard from April since the middle of the previous week did not mean April had been gone for that long&nbsp;it did not mean she was gone at all. And yet not a word in all that length of time, not even a phone call? With someone else a week's silence might not be remarked, but April was the kind of person people worried about, not because she was unable to look after herself but because she was altogether too sure she could. </p><p>The lamps were lit on either side of the door of the Shelbourne Hotel, they glowed eerily, like giant dandelion clocks. The caped and frock-coated porter, idling at the door, lifted his gray top hat and saluted her. She would have asked Jimmy Minor to meet her in the hotel, but Jimmy disdained such a swank place and would not set foot in it unless he was following up on a story or interviewing some visiting notable. She passed on, crossing Kildare Street, and went down the area steps to the Country Shop. Even through her glove she could feel how cold and greasily wet the stair rail was. Inside, though, the little cafvï¿½ was warm and bright, with a comforting fug of tea and baked bread and cakes. She took a table by the window. There were a few other customers, all of them women, in hats, with shopping bags and parcels. Phoebe asked for a pot of tea and an egg sandwich. She might have waited to order until Jimmy came, but she knew he would be late, as he always was&nbsp;deliberately, she suspected, for he liked to have it thought that he was so much busier than everyone else. The waitress was a large pink girl with a double chin and a sweet smile. There was a wen wedged in the groove beside her left nostril that Phoebe tried not to stare at. The tea that she brought was almost black, and bitter with tannin. The sandwich, cut in neat triangles, was slightly curled at the corners. </p><p>Where was April now, at this moment, and what was she doing? For she must be somewhere, even if not here. Any other possibility was not to be entertained. </p><p>A half hour passed before Jimmy arrived. She saw him through the window skipping down the steps, and she was struck as always by how slight he was, a miniature person, more like a wizened schoolboy than a man. He wore a transparent plastic raincoat the color of watery ink. He had thin red hair and a narrow, freckled face, and was always disheveled, as if he had been sleeping in his clothes and had just jumped out of bed. He was putting a match to a cigarette as he came through the door. He saw her and crossed to her table and sat down quickly, crushing his raincoat into a ball and stowing it under his chair. Jimmy did everything in a hurry, as if each moment were a deadline he was afraid he was about to miss. "Well, Pheeb," he said, "what's up?" There were sparkles of moisture in his otherwise lifeless hair. The collar of his brown corduroy jacket bore a light snowfall of dandruff, and when he leaned forward she caught a whiff of his tobacco- staled breath. Yet he had the sweetest smile, it was always a surprise, lighting up that pinched, sharp little face. It was one of his amusements to pretend that he was in love with Phoebe, and he would complain theatrically to anyone prepared to listen of her cruelty and hard-heartedness in refusing to entertain his advances. He was a crime reporter on the <i>Evening Mail</i>, though surely there were not enough crimes committed in this sleepy city to keep him as busy as he claimed to be. </p><p>She told him about April and how long it was since she had heard from her. "Only a week?" Jimmy said. "She's probably gone off with some guy. She is slightly notorious, you know." Jimmy affected an accent from the movies; it had started as a joke at his own expense&nbsp;"Jimmy Minor, ace reporter, at your service, lady!"&nbsp;but it had become a habit and now he seemed not to notice how it grated on those around him who had to put up with it. </p><p>"If she was going somewhere," Phoebe said, "she would have let me know, I'm sure she would." </p><p>The waitress came, and Jimmy ordered a glass of ginger beer and a beef sandwich&nbsp;"Plenty of horse radish, baby, slather it on, I like it hot." He pronounced it <i>hat</i>. The girl tittered. When she had gone he whistled softly and said, "That's some wart." </p><p>"Wen," Phoebe said. </p><p>"What?" </p><p>"It's a wen, not a wart." </p><p>Jimmy had finished his cigarette, and now he lit a new one. No one smoked as much as Jimmy did; he had once told Phoebe that he often found himself wishing he could have a smoke while he was already smoking, and that indeed on more than one occasion he had caught himself lighting a cigarette even though the one he had going was there in the ashtray in front of him. He leaned back on the chair and crossed one of his stick-like little legs on the other and blew a bugle-shaped stream of smoke at the ceiling. "So what do you think?" he said. </p><p>Phoebe was stirring a spoon round and round in the cold dregs in her cup. "I think something has happened to her," she said quietly. </p><p>He gave her a quick, sideways glance. "Are you really worried? I mean, really?" </p><p>She shrugged, not wanting to seem melodramatic, not giving him cause to laugh at her. He was still watching her sidelong, frowning. At a party one night in her flat he had told her he thought her friendship with April Latimer was funny, and added, "Funny peculiar, that's to say, not funny ha ha." He had been a little drunk and afterwards they had tacitly agreed to pretend to have forgotten this exchange, but the fact of what he had implied lingered between them uncomfortably. And laugh it off though she might, it had made Phoebe brood, and the memory of it still troubled her, a little. </p><p>"You're probably right, of course," she said now. "Probably it's just April being April, skipping off and forgetting to tell anyone." </p><p>But no, she did not believe it; she could not. Whatever else April might be she was not thoughtless like that, not where her friends were concerned. </p><p>The waitress came with Jimmy's order. He bit a half-moon from his sandwich and, chewing, took a deep draw of his cigarette. "What about the Prince of Bongo-Bongoland?" he asked thickly. He swallowed hard, blinking from the effort. "Have you made inquiries of His Majesty?" He was smiling now but there was a glitter to his smile and the sharp tip of an eyetooth showed for a second at the side. He was jealous of Patrick Ojukwu; all the men in their circle were jealous of Patrick, nicknamed the Prince. She often wondered, in a troubled and troubling way, about Patrick and April&nbsp;had they, or had they not? It had all the makings of a juicy scandal, the wild white girl and th...</p></p><h2>Landing Signals</h2><p>Book by Hiatt, Ben L., Grizzell, Patrick, Duval, Quinton, Davis, C.B., Crawford, Tom, Connor, Julia, Castellano, Olivia, Carver, Raymond, Breit, Luke, Blue, Jane, Everson, William, Wagner, D.

Their maverick approach to research resulted in truly pioneering science. <br><br> Wherever these men ventured, they were catalysts for great discoveries. Here Segre honors them in his typically inviting and elegant style and shows readers how they were far from "ordinary". While portraying their personal lives Segre, a scientist himself, gives readers an inside look at how science is <i>done</i>--collaboration, competition, the influence of politics, the role of intuition and luck, and the sense of wonder and curiosity that fuels these extraordinary minds. <br><br> <i>Ordinary Geniuses</i> will appeal to the readers of Simon Singh, Amir Aczel, and other writers exploring the history of scientific ideas and the people behind them.</p><p>Gino Segrï¿½ is professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania.

Portland, Or.</p><p>Stewart O&#39;Nan is a lecturer in the English department at Cornell University.</p><h2>Reminiscences of a Ranchman</h2><p><p>The decades of the 1870s and 1880s were the heyday of the Old West as the world has come to know it in stories and songs, plays, motion pictures, and television dramas. Edgar Beecher Bronson, the real-life prototype of that now familiar character, the tenderfoot from the East, went out where the West began when it began. When he took his first herd of cattle north of the North Platte River, he went into an area "of roughly three hundred thousand square miles [which] held no white man's habitation save the little camp of miners in the Black Hills, and had for its only tenant nomad bands of Cheyenne and of Oglala, Brulï¿½, and Uncapapa Sioux. . . . Bar one ranch immediately on the Platte River to the east of Fort Laramie, I was the first man to carry a herd of cattle into the Sioux country, and there locate and permanently maintain a ranch."</p><p>The story of Bronson's apprenticeship on the range and his evolution from a greenhorn puncher into an experienced old hand has come to be regarded as a classic of cow-country literature. If almost an excessive amount of excitement seemed to come his way, it "was not because I was hunting trouble, but was simply due to the fact that trouble seemed to take a lot of pleasure in hunting the few plains dwellers of that day in that region--it just came to all of us, in one form of another, in the course of the day's work in the late 1870s and early 1880s."</p></p><p></p><h2>The Discipline of Subjectivity: An Essay on Montaigne (Princeton Legacy Library, 1038)</h2><p><p>Through an interpretation of Montaigne's philosophical vision as expressed in his Essays, Ermanno Bencivenga contributes to the current debate about the "death of the subject" by developing a view of the self as a project of continuous construction rather than the source and foundation of knowledge. This latter, Cartesian conception of self-consciousness as a logical and epistemological starting point is, Bencivenga contends, delusive: the certainty it provides is more akin to faith than to a cognitive state. How then do we acquire knowledge of the self? Montaigne makes for a productive case study in this regard: he declares that he himself is the matter of his book, and that nothing but the constitution of his own self is his business. A study of Montaigne reveals that the fundamental category missing in the Cartesian conception of the self is that of practical effort. The self is not a ready-made entity, available for inspection and analysis, but something whose generation requires exercise, training, and discipline. It is the result of an operation that must be performed not just once, but, as in all training, over and over again until it becomes second nature. Bencivenga characterizes the particular training required by the project of constituting a subject as a revolutionary, transgressive, critical one, which shares with philosophical activity a profoundly playful irrelevance to the "ready to hand."</p><p>Originally published in 1990.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Deputy Marshal Russ Sittell is assigned to work with Texas Ranger Vaughan Steele to stop the rustling in Pecos County. En route to Fairdale, Russ falls in love with Ruth Herbert, who happens to be the niece of the villain. James effortlessly draws the listener into Russ's mind and heart, aiding in Grey's recreation of the romantic but violent Old West. James's striking and slick reading precisely presents the story's inspirational and timeless moral codes. S.C.A. ï¿½ AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright ï¿½ AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>In 1915, without consulting Grey (1872-1939), Harper and Bros. spliced together the last half of this book with the 1913 novel Last of the Duanes to create The Lone Star RangersAstill a popular title. This uncut version is Grey's only Western told in first person; the novel details U.S. Deputy Marshall Russ Sitwell's efforts to help legendary Texas Ranger Vaughn Steele clean up the lawless cattle-rustling town of Fairfield. Sitwell discovers that the town's mayor is in cahoots with a fierce band of outlawsAbut Steele has fallen in love with the mayor's daughter and Sitwell with his niece. Grey's characters have depth; unusual for the genre, he probes the psychic damage of cattle rustlingA"the bitterness, the defeat, the agony" felt by its victimsAwhich is glossed over in most cookie-cutter Westerns. One cowpoke, his spirit broken, is reduced to tears in front of Sitwell by the humiliation of losing his herd. This edition will delight fans and serve as a solid introduction for anyone unfamiliar with the Balzac of the range.

Emptiness does not imply a nihilistic worldview, but rather the idea that a permanent entity does not exist in any single phenomenon or being. Everything exists interdependently within an immeasurable quantity of causes and conditions. An understanding of emptiness allows us to see the world as a realm of infinite possibility, instead of a static system. Just like a table consists of wooden parts, and the wood is from a tree, and the tree depends on air, water, and soil, so is the world filled with a wondrous interdependence that extends to our own mind and awareness. In lucid, accessible language, Geshe Tashi Tsering guides the reader to a genuine understanding of this infinite possibility.</p><p>Geshe Tashi Tsering was born in Tibet in 1958 and received his Geshe Lharampa degree (similar to a doctorate in divinity) from Sera Monastery in India in 1987.

Author: Thupten Jinpa, principal translator for the Dalai Lama and director of the Institute of Tibetan Classics<br><br>"Although coming from a traditional Gelugpa presentation of the Buddhist path, these books are written for a modern western audience, and therefore 'happiness' is presented as a principle goal, alongside the more traditional goal of enlightenment.

In time, suspicion centers on Engand's great scientist, a Nobel laureate, and his henchman since their days at Trinity College. Leaving Blackford for long stretches, the narrative focuses on Beria, head of the secret police in the USSR, and his efforts to manipulate events after Stalin's death. There is also agitation in Washington, where the Dulles brothers, President Eisenhower and others are disturbed by the possibility that Russia has cracked the code in which messages are exchanged between the U.S. and England.

But now and throughout prefab's history, there have been many exceptions to the rule. Ground-breaking proposals from architects and designers such as Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Jean Prouve, Albert Frey, Buckminster Fuller, Sir Richard Rogers, Archigram, Kisho Kurokawa, and Philippe Starck, have emerged since Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. first marketed their Houses by Mail to the general public in 1908. Prefab examines the fascinating history of prefabricated housing over the last century to reveal a wealth of practical and attractive alternatives to the status quo. Prefab's primary focus is the work of more than twenty-five contemporary architects and designers who are exploring the myriad possibilities that prefabrication offers for housing for the future. From the poetic construction of Shigeru Ban to the industrial minimalism of KFN's portable structures, from the fantastical digitized aluminum prototypes of Greg Lynn to the stylish functionality of IKEA's prefab apartments, Prefab presents a series of innovative homes and concepts that boldly demonstrates how far this much maligned building technique has come, and how fat it can go. In doing so, Prefab endeavors to inspire a change in the way people think of housing and the way the architects, builders, developers, and financial institutions approach it--and ultimately, the way individuals live in it.Allison Arieff is a writer, senior editor of the architecture magazine dwell, and co-author of Trailer Travel.

Recently a team led by Ehud Netzer, a leading Israeli archaeologist of the Herodian period, discovered the tomb of Herod in one of his palaces two thousand years after his death. This volume highlights Herod's personal involvement with and contributions to his building projects, which benefited from his analytical mind, creative imagination, and deep understanding of the building and planning process. In many ways, the book presents the first comprehensive synthesis of Herod's enterprises from architectural and archaeological viewpoints.<br><br>"[Netzer] brings a strong architectural background . . . and intensive archaeological experience . . . to his analysis of Herod's buildings. . . . No one knows Herod's buildings as well as Netzer; he distills what he knows about him in this readable book. He neither talks down to nonarchitects nor uses highly technical vocabulary. . . . Since he has excavated many of the sites himself and has worked extensively with the excavators of most of the others, the study is based on intimate familiarity with Herod and his world. . . . His deft touch in this book will ensure that his views are known more widely to an English-speaking audience, as he provides a near-infallible guide to understanding and appreciating Herod's buildings. . . . This is a book about which one can get quite excited; Netzer has accomplished much in his lengthy career focused on Herod. . . . There is still more to learn about this remarkable ruler and the products of his fertile imagination; Netzer is now the indispensable starting point."--<b>Peter Richardson</b>, <i>Review of Biblical Literature<br><br></i>"In assessing Herod's construction projects, Netzer enjoys the advantage of having personally uncovered many of these sites, giving him an intimate familiarity with the subject. . . .

At this dark juncture, a World&#39;s Fair was held in New York City that evoked such acute hope in its promise of a glorious future that a whole generation was drawn to it and transformed by its vision. of photos.</p><p>This book is a strange beast: a meditation on the meaning of the 1939 New York World's Fair seen through the lens of David Gelernter's angry political opinion that society today has gone to moral rot and ruin--mostly because of the ideas of New York-style liberals, who have led us astray. Richly detailed observations of the 1939 World's Fair and its social milieu are interspersed with a rather sparse fictional account of an old-fashioned romance that got its fuse lit on the fairgrounds. If you want a straightforward 1939 World's Fair novel, the classic is still <i>World's Fair</i>, by E. L. Doctorow. But Gelernter writes likes nobody else. His historical research is painstaking, and his pro-1939, anti-modern political jeremiad gives the book an eccentric but propulsive narrative drive. Gelernter has a qualified love of two-fisted old-time social engineers, such as Robert Moses, and he yearns for a time when society was ruled by authority figures instead of celebrities. Ah, the good old days, when the 1939 World's Fair introduced America to TV, the fax machine, nylons, fluorescent lighting, long-distance phone calls, and an underwater Salvador Dali exhibit starring live, half-nude women. Gelernter wrote this book while recovering from a murder attempt by the Unabomber (recounted in Gelernter's <i>Drawing Life</i>), but his true claim to fame is the cranky individualism of his mind.David Gelernter is professor of computer science at Yale University.</p><h2>Unknown Means</h2><p>In Elizabeth Becka's latest highly suspenseful novel, forensic scientist Evelyn James returns to investigate a harrowing series of crimes--only to find that no one is safe.<br><br> Evelyn James is a forensic specialist in the Cleveland Medical Examiner's office who's juggling a demanding workload, a teenage daughter from a failed marriage, and a homicide detective boyfriend. And somehow she always happens to be involved in some of the twistiest, most challenging crime scenes imaginable.<br><br> This time around she's called in to investigate what appears to be a locked-room mystery: A wealthy woman is murdered in the penthouse suite of a luxurious, high-security building. The building's intricate surveillance system didn't pick up anything, the entrance wasn't forced, and the victim's husband has an airtight alibi. Cases like this, Evelyn knows, can turn on the most microscopic piece of evidence--if she can find any. Things look even trickier when another victim turns up in another penthouse suite. Then Evelyn's best friend is attacked--and things get personal. And when a third person is found dead, Evelyn realizes that the killer's choice of victim is anything but random. . . .</p><p><strong>Elizabeth Becka</strong> is a forensic specialist working with the Cape Coral, Florida, police department. Formerly with the Coroner's Office of Cleveland, Ohio, she has lectured to students and officers, has testified as an expert witness forty times, and is a member of the American Academy of Forensic Scientists.Forensic scientist Evelyn James of the Cleveland Medical Examiner's office returns for this welcome second novel, following Becka's debut, <i>Trace Evidence</i>. Single mother Evelyn must manage her relationship with her sullen teenage daughter, her sputtering romance with homicide detective David Milaski and the demands of a job she loves. As the book opens, a wealthy woman is found murdered in a locked apartment; soon, Evelyn's friend and colleague Marissa Gonzalez, who lives in the same high-security building as the murdered woman, is attacked twice, and another woman is murdered elsewhere. Evelyn works with Milaski and his partner, Bruce Riley, to find the connection among the victims. In addition, claustrophobic Evelyn must collect trace evidence following a salt mine explosion under Lake Erie. Becka, a Cape Coral, Fla., forensic scientist formerly with the Cleveland coroner's office, keeps the details of this gripping procedural vivid all the way up to the harrowing finale. Fans of Patricia Cornwell's prickly Kay Scarpetta will find Evelyn a complementary contrast. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Vaudeville was the preferred form of entertainment, until the popularization of the silent film. This new medium proved to be a draw for many of the stars of the Vaudevillian stage and soon they migrated to the exciting possibilities that the movies had to offer. Audiences were instantly enthralled and captivated by the stars of the silent screen. The early days of Hollywood were full of glamour and a newfound decadence. The stars in these films were instantly catapulted to fame and fortune and the spotlight of the public eye. The real people behind the glamour were far different than the characters that audiences grew to know and love and much like Hollywood today, the lives of the stars were often full of scandal and debauchery.<br><br>This book examines the forgotten scandals of yesterday, featuring silent and silver screen stars like Jean Harlow, Mae West, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and Errol Flynn.

Cohan, Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern, the names of their black counterparts - Will Marion Cook, George Walker and Bob Cole, among others - are virtually unknown today. Allen Woll aims to remedy that neglect in this book, offering a thoroughly researched account of the evolution of black musical theatre from the turn of the century to the present day. In his discussion of the careers of Ethel Walters, Eubie Blake and Lena Horne, to name just a few of the luminaries considered here and in his outlines and analyses of &#34;A Trip to Coontown&#34;, &#34;Shuffle Along&#34;, &#34;Porgy and Bess&#34;, &#34;Ain&#39;t Misbehavin&#39;&#34;, &#34;The Wiz&#34;, &#34;Dreamgirls&#34; and dozens of other shows, Woll brings the works vividly to life. &#34;Black Musical Theatre&#34; should become an essential reference and guide for anyone interested in theatre and African American history.</p><p>Black Musical Theatre begins its historical survey with Clorindy, the Origin of the Cakewalk and A Trip to Coontown, in 1898, and concludes with the Broadway smash Dreanigirls, in 1981. The section on the ragtime pianist and composer Eubie Blake and his popular 1920s show, Shuffle Along, attests to early black influence in American musical theater. Prior to the 1920s, black musical theater was enriched by Walker and Williams, Cole and Johnson, Miller and Lyles, and Ernest Hogan. White producers and composers such as George Gershwin (Porgy and Bess) who were deeply involved in black musicals are given due coverage, and the problems inherent in relations with whites over such issues as stereotyping are fully examined. Other political issues such as the lack of social criticism in white-created musicals is treated with perception. The photographs are often chosen from the Billy Rose Theatre Collection, New York Public Library, and add a visual dimension to the exposition that will be of great value to students of musical history. Costume and scenery designers will also appreciate the stills from Hot Mikado, Carmen Jones, and The Wiz. Other illustrations include sheet music, performers (such as Louis Armstrong), and programs. The tap dance, gospel songs, jazz. and other elements of musical theater were perfected by black performers and composers, and were an intricate part of the Broadway tradition that has since extended its influence into television, popular music, and film. Both academic and public libraries should buy their share of this readable, socially relevant, thoroughly researched book. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Theater historian Woll's scholarly yet entertaining account of the rise, fall, and resurrection of the black musical fleshes out a neglected but vital aspect of American musical theater. Woll starts with minstrel shows and "coon songs" and follows the development of the musical through the great shows of the twenties to current-day blockbusters like Ain't Misbehavin' . Throughout, stage history has paralleled social history; a subtext of discrimination against black performers and authors underscores Woll's splendid re-creation of the world of Cole and Johnson, Williams and Walker, Florence Mills, and countless others. A discography would have been welcome, but this is a minor complaint about a well-researched and admirable work. Essential for all theater and black studies collections.

The Panzers that crossed the Meuse at Sedan in May 1940 cut the French Army in two; the Wehrmacht's ability to cross the great rivers of the western USSR was vital to the lightning advances of Operation Barbarossa in 1941, and in 1943-45 the Red Army had to drive the Germans back from a succession of river lines during their advance to the Reich, culminating in the Vistula and Oder lines; in Italy the Rapido formed a bloody moat for the Cassino defences; and after D-Day the milestones on the Western Allies' advances were the Seine, the Somme, the Moselle, and finally the Rhine. </p><p>The initial (hopefully surprise) assault could be made by infantry in light assault boats, and over rudimentary improvised bridges. But World War II armies depended on heavy mechanized equipment, and even if a bridgehead was seized, it then had to be held for long enough for engineers to bring up and erect prefabricated bridges strong enough to carry the tanks and artillery without which the bridgehead was doomed. Some of the most savage fighting of the war took place around bridgeheads, and the Allies invested considerable resources in the development of equipment and tactics for contested river crossings.</p><p>This book explains the methods and the means, and analyzes specific successes and failures. It features a wealth of wartime photos, particularly from German sources, and full-color plates illustrate tactical scenarios that bring the subject alive.</p></p><p>Gordon L.

The chapters cover the key areas in which biotechnology has had an impact on today&#x2019;s world, including ecology, biomedicine, designer genomes, and changing approaches to evolutionary theory, and include profiles of the work of sixty artists, collectives, and organizations from around the world.

Specifically, these advances alter our notions of the self, environment, and the definition of life. Popular understanding strains to catch up with these changes while artists are detecting and vigorously responding to them, creating new images, sculpture, living material installations, video, and performance. In this way the work of bioartists echoes that of the Surrealists of the early 20th century who reacted to the new terrain of the unconscious and widespread anxiety in the aftermath of industrialized war.William Myers is a writer, teacher, and curator based in Amsterdam.

Gaston and the Making of a Black American Millionaire</h2><p>The grandson of slaves, born into poverty in 1892 in the Deep South, A. G. Gaston died more than a century later with a fortune worth well over $130 million and a business empire spanning communications, real estate, and insurance. Gaston was, by any measure, a heroic figure whose wealth and influence bore comparison to J. P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. Here, for the first time, is the story of the life of this extraordinary pioneer, told by his niece and grandniece, the award-winning television journalist Carol Jenkins and her daughter Elizabeth Gardner Hines.<br><br>Born at a time when the bitter legacy of slavery and Reconstruction still poisoned the lives of black Americans, Gaston was determined to make a difference for himself and his people. His first job, after serving in the celebrated all-black regiment during World War I, bound him to the near-slavery of an Alabama coal mine&#x2014;but even here Gaston saw not only hope but opportunity. He launched a business selling lunches to fellow miners, soon established a rudimentary bank&#x2014;and from then on there was no stopping him. A kind of black Horatio Alger, Gaston let a single, powerful question be his guide: <i>What do our people need now?</i> His success flowed from an uncanny genius for knowing the answer. <br><br>Combining rich family lore with a deep knowledge of American social and economic history, Carol Jenkins and Elizabeth Hines unfold Gaston&#x2019;s success story against the backdrop of a century of crushing racial hatred and bigotry. Gaston not only survived the hardships of being black during the Depression, he flourished, and by the 1950s he was ruling a Birmingham-based business empire. When the movement for civil rights swept through the South in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gaston provided critical financial support to many activists.<br><br>At the time of his death in 1996, A. G. Gaston was one of the wealthiest black men in America, if not <i>the</i> wealthiest. But his legacy extended far beyond the monetary. He was a man who had proved it was possible to overcome staggering odds and make a place for himself as a leader, a captain of industry, and a far-sighted philanthropist. Writing with grace and power, Jenkins and Hines bring their distinguished ancestor fully to life in the pages of this book. <i>Black Titan</i> is the story of a man who created his own future&#x2014;and in the process, blazed a future for all black businesspeople in America.</p><p>&#x201c;No library of American business achievement is complete without the story of Arthur G.

Acclaimed critic Clinton Heylin seamlessly weaves together the lives of disparate artists who had in common not the music (there was no distribution) but the pictures, words, and fashions depicted in magazines like <i>Creem</i> and <i>NME</i> . It was a sound that eschewed conventional lyrics, promoted a gutteral musicality but yet contained a keen pop sensibility. Whether exploring the work of early progenitors like Suicide, The New York Dolls, and Patti Smith or charting the progress of the bands who legitimately took up the mantle in the eighties and nineties, Clinton Heylin brings to life the strands of a global artform. From the Sex Pistols&#x2019;s clarion call of a record, Never Mind the Bollocks,&#x201d; to Kurt Cobain&#x2019;s songs of an alienated youth, <i>Babylon&#x2019;s Burning </i> is the brilliant, exhaustively researched story that once and for all defines what Punk is and is not.</p><p>When it comes to the heyday of punk rock in the mid to late 1970s, Heylin has put together a solid history, drawing upon interviews with many of the key players from the era. The focus on London bands like the Sex Pistols and the Clash is unsurprising, but New York combos like the Ramones and Television also get their due, and even groups whose influence is less generally recognized, like Cleveland's Pere Ubu or Australia's Radio Birdman, receive well-rounded treatment. Heylin (<i>From the Velvets to the Voidoids</i>) is opinionated, but only rarely do his undisguised preferences disrupt the story. (One notable exception comes when he calls the death of Sid Vicious's girlfriend, Nancy, "justifiable homicide.") If he'd simply closed out his account with the suicide of Joy Division's Ian Curtis in 1980, Heylin would have perfectly captured the punk era. Instead, he spends another hundred pages building up to the death of Kurt Cobain, branded as a poser and a sellout. That the story so quickly works its way to Nirvana after such an in-depth exploration of the '70s underscores the tacked-on feeling of these final chapters. It's a shame, because the core material is strong enough that it didn't need to grasp at such ersatz "relevance." <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yeats Vol. III: Autobiographies</h2><p><i>Autobiographies</i> consists of six autobiographical works that William Butler Yeats published together in the mid-1930s to form a single, extraordinary memoir of the first fifty-eight years of his life, from his earliest memories of childhood to winning the Nobel Prize for Literature. This volume provides a vivid series of personal accounts of a wide range of figures, and it describes Yeats's work as poet and playwright, as a founder of Dublin's famed Abbey Theatre, his involvement with Irish nationalism, and his fascination with occultism and visions. This book is most compelling as Yeats's own account of the growth of his poetic imagination. Yeats thought that a poet leads a life of allegory, and that his works are comments upon it. <i>Autobiographies</i> enacts his ruling belief in the connections and coherence between the life that he led and the works that he wrote. It is a vision of personal history as art, and so it is the one truly essential companion to his poems and plays. <br> Edited by William H. O'Donnell and Douglas N. Archibald, this volume is available for the first time with invaluable explanatory notes and includes previously unpublished passages from candidly explicit first drafts.</p><p>William Butler Yeats is generally considered to be Ireland&#x2019;s greatest poet, living or dead, and one of the most important literary figures of the twentieth century.

Only one thing would make him happier: having a class pet. He asks his teacher, Mrs. Sealey, but she decides the class first needs some practice. Everyone will make a pet egg. If they can show they are responsible by taking good care of their pretend pets, they will get a real class pet.<br><br>Barnaby is sure this will be easy. He already cares for a pet--his dog, Baxter. But when his egg cracks, Barnaby isn't sure what to do. Should he lie to Mrs. Sealey? In the end, Barnaby tells the truth and the class is rewarded with a wonderful real pet--a bunny.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 2-Barnaby, of coloring-book fame, is a sweet and cuddly bear whose friends include a frog and a giraffe, among others. In response to her students' request for a class pet, Mrs. Sealey assigns each pupil the care of a pet egg, with the promise that if they are responsible, they can get a real pet. All of the classmates care for their charges, except the overly confident cub, who admits in the end that he was careless. After careful consideration, his teacher decides to commend him on his honesty. The didactic, almost pedantic tone results in a very long read. Some pages are divided into thirds, making the format somewhat awkward; the tale is rather cumbersome. The lively artwork, suggesting the many adventures the classmates experience, has a frolicsome feel.

More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. "In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey," the narrator recalls. "Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket." And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p> The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exupï¿½ry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary: </p><blockquote> I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote> The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <i>Peter Pan</i>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. "Trying to be witty," we're told at one point, "leads to lying, more or less." But Saint-Exupï¿½ry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <i>--James Marcus</i>First published in 1943<br>Previous hardcover edition 2000<br>0-15-202398-4<br></p><h2>His Dark Materials</h2><p><p>With sales of three-quarters of a million copies last year alone, Philip Pullman&#x2019;s trilogy <i>His Dark Materials </i>is already acknowledged as a classic.

The first was that I got hooked on salami. Salami sandwiches, salami and cheese, salami on crackersï¿½I couldn't get enough of the salty, spicy sausage. The other thing was that my mom and I weren't getting along really well. We weren't fighting really badly or anything, but it just seemed as if all she wanted to do was argue with me and tell me what to do. We also didn't laugh together much anymore. Things were changing, and my mom and I were the first to feel it.</p> <p>As far as the salami went, my mom wouldn't buy any because she said it was too expensive and not that good for me. To prove my emerging independence, I decided to go ahead and eat what I wanted anyway. So one day I used my allowance to buy a full sausage of dry salami.</p> <p>Now a problem had to be solved: Where would I put the salami? I didn't want my mom to see it. So I hid it in the only place that I knew was totally safeï¿½under my bed. There was a special corner under the bed that the upright Hoover couldn't reach and that my mom rarely had the ambition to clean. Under the bed went the salami, back in the cornerï¿½in the dark and the dust.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, I remembered the delicious treat that was waiting for me. I peered beneath the bed and saw...not the salami that I had hidden, but some green and hairy object that didn't look like anything I had ever seen before. The salami had grown about an inch of hair, and the hair was standing straight up, as if the salami had been surprised by the sudden appearance of my face next to its hiding place. Being the picky eater I was, I was not interested in consuming any of <i>this</i> object. The best thing I could think of to do was ... <i>absolutely nothing</i>.</p> <p>Sometime later, my mom became obsessed with spring cleaning, which in her case meant she would clean places that had never seen the light of day. Of course, that meant under my bed. I knew in my heart that the moment would soon come when she would find the object in its hiding place. During the first two days of her frenzy, I watched carefully to judge the time when I thought she would find the salami. She washed, she scrubbed, she dusted.., <i>she screamed</i>! She screamed and screamed and screamed. "Ahhhhhhï¿½ahhhhhhï¿½ahhhhhh!" The screams were coming from my room. Alarms went off in my head. She had found the salami!</p> <p>"What is it, Mom?" I yelled as I ran into my room. "There is something under your bed!"</p> <p>"What's under my bed?" I opened my eyes very wide to show my complete innocence.</p> <p>"Something ... something... I don't know what it is!" She finally stopped screaming. Then she whispered, "Maybe it's alive."</p> <p>I got down to look under my bed.</p> <p>"Watch out!" she shouted. "I don't know what it is!" she said again. She pushed me to one side. I was proud of the bravery she was demonstrating to Save me from the "something" in spite of her distress.</p> <p>I was amazed at what I saw. The last time I had looked at the salami, the hair on it was about an inch long and fuzzy all over. Now, the hair had grown another three inches, was a gray-green color and had actually started to grow on the surrounding area as well. You could no longer tell the actual shape of what the hair was covering. I looked at my mom. Except for the color, her hair closely resembled the hair on the salami: It was standing straight up, too! Abruptly she got up and left the room, only to return five seconds later with the broom.</p> <p>Using the handle of the broom, she poked the salami. It didn't move. She poked it harder. It still didn't move. At that point, I wanted to te11 her what it was, but I couldn't seem to make my mouth work. My chest was squeezing with an effort to repress the laughter that, unbidden, was threatening to explode. At the same time, I was terrified of her rage when she finally discovered what it was. I was also afraid she was going to, have a heart attack because she looked so scared.</p> <p> Finally my mom got up her nerve and pushed the salami really hard. At that same exact moment, the laughter I had been trying to hold back exploded from my mouth. She dropped the broom and looked at me.</p> <p>"What's so funny?" my mom asked. Up close, two inches from my face, she looked furious. Maybe it was just the position of having her head lower than her bottom that made her face so red, but I was sure she was about to poke me with the broom handle. I sure didn't want that to happen because it still had some pieces of gray-green hair sticking to it. I felt kind of sick, but then another one of my huge laughs erupted. It was as if I had no control over my body. One followed another, and pretty soon I was rolling on the floor. My mom sat downï¿½hard.</p> <p><i>"What is so funny?!"</i></p> <p>"Salami," I managed to get out despite the gales of laughter that I had no control over. "Salami! Salami!" I rolled on the floor. "It's a salami!"</p> <p>My mother gazed at me with disbelief. What did salami have to do with anything? The object under the bed did not look like any salami she had ever seen. In fact, it did not look like <i>anything</i> she (or I) had ever seen.</p> <p>I gasped for breath. "Mom, it's a salamiï¿½you know, one of those big salami sausages!"</p> <p>She asked what any sane mother would ask in this situation. "What is a salami doing under your bed?"</p> <p>"I bought it with my allowance." My laughter was subsiding, and fear was beginning to take its place. I looked at her. She had the strangest expression on her face that I had ever seen: a combination of disgust, confusion, exhaustion, fearï¿½and <i>anger!</i> Her hair was standing on end, perspiration beaded on her flushed face and her eyes looked as if they were going to jump out of her head. I couldn't help it. I started to laugh again.</p> <p> And then the miracle of miracles happened. My mom started to laugh, too. First just a nervous release, a titter really, but then it turned into the full-on belly laugh that only my mom's side of the family is capable of. The two of us laughed until tears rolled down our cheeks and thought I would pee my pants.</p> <p>When we finally were able to stop laughing, my mom shoved the broom into my hands.</p> <p>"Okay, Patty Jean Shaw, <i>clean it up</i>, no matter what it is!" I had no idea how to clean up something and not look at it or touch it. So, of course, I got my little sister to help me. I could get her to help with anything, as long as I bribed or threatened her. Since she didn't know what the object was supposed to look like to begin with, she didn't have much fear attached to helping. Between the two of us, we managed to roll it onto the evening newspaper (my dad never knew what happened to it). I <i>carefully</i>, carefully carried it outside and put it into the trash. Then I had my sister remove the remaining fuzz from the carpet. I had convinced her that I was too large to get into the small corner where it had grown. I ended up owing her my allowance for two weeks.</p> <p> My mom never got mad at me for buying the salami. I guess she thought I had already paid a price. The salami provided a memory of shared, unrestrained laughter. For years to come, all I had to do was threaten to buy salami to make my mom laugh.</p><br><br> ï¿½<i>Patty Hansen</i><br><br> <p>ï¿½1998. All rights reserved.

This myth&#x2015;that Communism was a Jewish plot to destroy the nations of Europe&#x2015;was a paranoid fantasy, and yet fears of a Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy took hold during the Russian Revolution and spread across Europe. During World War II, these fears sparked genocide.</p><p>Paul Hanebrink&#x2019;s history begins with the counterrevolutionary movements that roiled Europe at the end of World War I. Fascists, Nazis, conservative Christians, and other Europeans, terrified by Communism, imagined Jewish Bolsheviks as enemies who crossed borders to subvert order from within and bring destructive ideas from abroad. In the years that followed, Judeo-Bolshevism was an accessible and potent political weapon.</p><p>After the Holocaust, the specter of Judeo-Bolshevism did not die. Instead, it adapted to, and became a part of, the Cold War world. Transformed yet again, it persists today on both sides of the Atlantic in the toxic politics of revitalized right-wing nationalism. Drawing a worrisome parallel across one hundred years, Hanebrink argues that Europeans and Americans continue to imagine a transnational ethno-religious threat to national ways of life, this time from Muslims rather than Jews.</p></p><p>Paul Hanebrink is Associate Professor of History at Rutgers University&#x2013;New Brunswick. He is the author of <i>In Defense of Christian Hungary: Religion, Nationalism, and Antisemitism, 1890&#x2013;1944</i>.&#x201c;A timely reminder of the intellectual tradition deployed by Republican politicians in the U.S. when they join the loose coalition of conspiracy theorists across the Atlantic gleefully demonizing George Soros. It is both salutary and depressing to be reminded of how enduring the trope of an exploitative global Jewish conspiracy against pure, humble and selfless nationalists really is...A century after the end of the first world war, we have, it seems, learned very little.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark Mazower</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the great merits of Paul Hanebrink&#x2019;s <i>A Specter Haunting Europe</i> is its demonstration of how Europe&#x2019;s most pervasive and powerful twentieth-century manifestation of anti-Semitic thought&#x2015;the myth of Judeo-Bolshevism&#x2015;emerged before the rise of National Socialism and has continued to have a curious life long after the Holocaust and the defeat of Nazi Germany.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher R. Browning</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Magisterial...Hanebrink&#x2019;s book covers this dark history with insight and skill. He has the linguistic ability to bring Eastern Europe fully into the narrative, and the vision to include American and Western European debates, too. The end result is a major intervention into our understanding of 20th-century Europe and the lessons we ought to take away from its history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Chappel</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This masterful interpretation of the origins and trajectory of the Judeo-Bolshevik myth is far more than a new classic in the canon of the writing of twentieth-century history. With the politics of exclusion and Islamophobia now sweeping Europe, alongside the election of Donald Trump in the United States, Paul Hanebrink&#x2019;s reconstruction of the conspiratorial imagination that led shadowy others to be blamed&#x2015;and worse&#x2015;is an indispensable warning for our own time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Samuel Moyn, author of <i>Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Hanebrink follows the myth&#x2019;s twisted course from its European origins in the immediate aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution, through the jaundiced politics of the interwar period, to its devastating culmination in Nazi Germany...He argues that it survives today in the resurgent right-wing nationalism cropping up in many Western countries. From the start, the fantasy held that an alien element&#x2015;the Jews&#x2015;aimed to subvert the cultural values and national identities of Western societies. As Hanebrink points out, this theme is echoed in modern anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. The writers, politicians, and shills whose poisonous ideas he exhumes have many contemporary admirers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Legvold</b><b>, </b><b><i>Foreign Affairs</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Thoughtful and informative...In addition to examining the origins and influence of the Judeo-Bolshevik myth in the period from 1917 to 1945, Hanebrink attempts to show that it is still an important element in anti-Semitism, both in Europe and beyond...While Judeo-Bolshevism may have lost its resonance, Paul Hanebrink is right to insist that its history still matters, both as a key to understanding the tragic fate of Europe&#x2019;s Jews in the first half of the twentieth century and as a reminder of how myths can open the way to political and moral catastrophe.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James J. Sheehan</b><b>, </b><b><i>Commonweal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As Paul Hanebrink demonstrates in this masterly account, the myth of Judaeo-Bolshevism rose on a tide of hysteria whipped up by the chaos in central Europe that marked the end of the Great War...This in turn fed easily into a vicious racist rhetoric that characterized much of the discourse of the political right in Europe between the two world wars and which was of course a cornerstone of the Nazi enterprise.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Geoffrey Alderman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An edifying new book that serves as a valuable addition to the corpus of scholarship on the long history of antisemitism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tibor Krausz</b><b>, </b><b><i>Jerusalem Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;During World War II the phantom idea of Judeo-Bolshevism fueled genocides that killed millions of Jews and East Europeans, but, as Paul Hanebrink tells us, we hear its echoes anytime politicians stir fears about outsiders threatening civilization&#x2015;whether they call it European, Western, or Christian. Hanebrink&#x2019;s tour de force is rare in its brilliance and originality, but also urgent in its message for our time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Connelly, author of <i>From Enemy to Brother: The Revolution in Catholic Teaching on the Jews, 1933&#x2013;1965</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Tremendous...Could not be more timely...These are dangerous times and we need to know as much about the history and politics of the far-right as we can.

This book by Dr Graham Cole takes steps to fill the need. Undoubtedly more can be said, but it is immensely satisfying to find an able systematician wrestling with the biblical texts . . . not least on a topic as central to the Christian faith as this one."

But, it was such an enjoyable experience, before I knew it, I had also worked my way through <em>God The Peacemaker: How Atonement Brings Shalom</em> (excellent). . . . Like most all the volumes in this series I have read, this book was richly biblical, theological insightful, and pastorally relevant."

Bradbury's vividly painted society holds up the appearance of happiness as the highest goal--a place where trivial information is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Fire Captain Beatty explains it this way, "Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs.... Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy." <p> Guy Montag is a book-burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. His wife spends all day with her television "family," imploring Montag to work harder so that they can afford a fourth TV wall. Their dull, empty life sharply contrasts with that of his next-door neighbor Clarisse, a young girl thrilled by the ideas in books, and more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless chatter of the tube. When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Montag is moved to make some changes, and starts hiding books in his home. Eventually, his wife turns him in, and he must answer the call to burn his secret cache of books. After fleeing to avoid arrest, Montag winds up joining an outlaw band of scholars who keep the contents of books in their heads, waiting for the time society will once again need the wisdom of literature.</p><p> Bradbury--the author of more than 500 short stories, novels, plays, and poems, including <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> and <i>The Illustrated Man</i>--is the winner of many awards, including the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America.

In 2011, Ted wrote the sequel to Polly and the Pirates, and illustrated several Batman short stories for DC Comics.

A first novel. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Rani Manicka, an economics graduate, was born and educated in Malaysia. Infused with her own South Asian family history, <i>The Rice Mother</i> is her first novel.<b>Lakshmi<br><br></b>I was born in Ceylon in 1916, at a time when spirits walked the earth just like people, before the glare of electricity and the roar of civilization had frightened them away into the concealed hearts of forests. There they dwelled inside enormous trees full of cool, blue-green shade. In the dappled stillness you could reach out and almost feel their silent, glaring presence yearning for physical form. If the urge to relieve ourselves beset us while we were passing through the jungle, we had to say a prayer and ask their permission before our waste could touch the ground, for they were easily offended. Their solitude broken was the excuse they used to enter an intruder. And walk in his legs.<p>Mother said her sister was once lured off and possessed by just such a spirit, and a holy man from two villages away had to be sent for to exorcise the evil in her. He wore many chains of strangely twisted beads and dried roots around his neck, testaments to his fearsome powers. The simple villagers gathered, a human ring of curiosity around the man. To drive the spirit away, he began to beat my aunt with a long, thin cane, all the time demanding, "What do you want?" He filled the peaceful village with her terrified screams, but unmoved, he carried on beating her poor body until it bled streams of red.</p><p>"You are killing her," my grandmother howled, held back by three appalled yet horribly fascinated women. Ignoring her, the holy man fingered a livid pink scar that ran all the way down his face and walked his determined, tight circles around the cowering girl, always with the darkly whispered query, "What do you want?" Until eventually she screamed shrilly that it was a fruit she wanted.</p><p>"Fruit? What sort of fruit?" he asked sternly, halting before the sobbing girl.</p><p>A shocking transformation occurred suddenly. The little face looked up at him slyly, and perhaps there was even a bubble of madness in the grin that slowly and with unspeakable obscenity spread its legs on her lips. Coyly she pointed to her younger sister, my mother. "That is the fruit I want," she said, her voice unmistakably male.</p><p>The simple villagers were united in their gasp of stunned shock. Needless to say the tall man did not give my mother to the spirit, for she was surely her father's favorite. The spirit had to make do with five lemons, cut and flung into its face, a searing sprinkling of sacred water, and a suffocating amount of myrrh.</p><p>When I was very young I used to rest quietly on my mother's lap, listening to her voice remember happier times. You see, my mother was descended from a family of such wealth and influence that in their heyday her English grandmother, Mrs. Armstrong, had been called upon to give a posy of flowers and shake the gloved hand of Queen Victoria herself. My mother was born partially deaf, but her father put his lips against her forehead and spoke to her tirelessly until she learned to speak. By the time she was sixteen she was as beautiful as a cloud maiden. Proposals of marriage came from far and wide to the lovely house in Colombo, but alas, she fell in love with the scent of danger. Her elongated eyes lowered on a charming rogue.</p><p>One night she climbed out of her window and down the very neem tree upon which her father had trained a thorny bougainvillea bush when she was only a year old in an effort to deter any man from ever scaling the tree and reaching his daughter's window. As if his pure thoughts had fed the bush, it grew and grew until the entire tree, ablaze with flowers, became a landmark that could be seen for miles around. But Grandfather had not reckoned on his own child's determination.</p><p>That moonlit night thorns like bared fangs shredded her thick clothes, ripped her hair, and plunged deep into her flesh, but she couldn't stop. Beneath was the man she loved. When at last she stood before him, there was not an inch of her skin that didn't burn as if aflame. Silently the waiting shadow led her away, but every step was like a knife in her foot, so she begged in terrible pain to rest. The wordless silhouette swung her up and carried her away. Safe inside the warm circle of his arms, she looked back at her home, grand against the vivid night sky, and saw her own bloody footprints leading away from the tree. They remained to taunt her father. She cried then, knowing that they would hurt his poor heart the most. He would beat his own head and cry, "How willing her betrayal?"</p><p>The lovers married at daybreak in a small temple in another village. In the ensuing bitter quarrel, the groom, my father, who was in fact the resentful son of a servant in my grandfather's employ, forbade my mother even the mere sight of any member of her family. Only after my father was gray ash in the wind did she return to her family home, but by then her mother was a widow gray with loss.</p><p>After issuing his heartless sentence, my father brought my mother to our backward little village far away from Colombo. He sold some of her jewelry, bought some land, built a house, and installed her in it. But clean air and wedded bliss didn't suit the new bridegroom, and soon he was off-lured away by the bright lights in the cities, summoned by the delights of cheap alcohol served by garishly painted prostitutes, and intoxicated by the smell fanned out of a pack of cards. After each absence he returned and presented his young wife with jar upon jar of all manner of white lies pickled in various brands of alcohol. For some obscure reason he thought she had a taste for them. Poor Mother, all she had left were her memories and me, precious things that she used to take out every evening. First she washed off the grime of the years with her own tears, then she polished them with the worn cloth of regret. And finally, when their wonderful sparkle had been returned to them, she laid them out one by one for me to admire before carefully returning them to their golden box inside her head.</p><p>From her mouth issued visions of a glorious past full of armies of devoted servants, fine carriages drawn by white horses, and iron chests filled with gold and rich jewelry. How could I, sitting on the cement floor of our tiny hut, even begin to imagine a house so high on a hill that all of Colombo was visible from its front balcony, or a kitchen so huge that our entire house could fit into it?</p><p>My mother once said that when she was first placed into her father's arms, tears of joy streamed down his face at the sight of her unusually fair skin and her full head of thick, black hair. He held the small bundle close to his face, and for a while all he could do was breathe in that strange, sweetish odor that is a newborn baby. Then he strode into the stables, his white veshti flapping against his strong brown legs, jumped onto his favorite stallion, and galloped off in a cloud of dust. When he returned, it was with the two largest emerald pieces that the entire village had ever seen. He presented them to his wife, little baubles in return for a marvelous miracle. She had them fashioned into diamond-encrusted earrings that she was never seen without.</p><p>I have never seen the famous emeralds, but I still have the black-and-white studio photograph of a sad-eyed woman standing stiffly in front of a badly painted background, a coconut tree growing on the edge of a beach. I look at her often, frozen on a piece of paper long after she is no more.</p><p>My mother said that when I was born, she cried to see that I was only a girl, and my disgusted father disappeared to make more pickled lies, returning two years later still roaring drunk. Despite this I still retain crystal-clear memories of a village life so happy and so carefree that not a day goes by in adulthood that I don't think about it with a bittersweet ache. How can I even begin to tell you how much I miss those carefree days when I was Mother's only child, her sun, her moon, her stars, her heart? When I was so loved and so precious that I had to be coaxed into eating? When Mother would come out of the house with a plate of food in her hand and search the village for me so she could feed me with her own hand, all so the tedious business of food would not interrupt my play?</p><p>How not to miss those days when the sun was a happy companion that stayed to play all year round and kissed me a careless nut brown? When Mother caught the sweet rain in her well behind the house, and the air was so clear that the grass smelled green?</p><p>An innocent time when the dusty dirt roads were surrounded by slanting coconut trees and dotted with simple village folk on rickety bicycles, their teeth stained red inside untroubled laughter. When the plot behind each house was a supermarket, and one slaughtered goat was adequate for eight households blissfully unaware of an invention called the refrigerator. When mothers needed only the gods who gathered in the white clouds above as baby-sitters to watch over their children playing in the waterfall.</p><p>Yes, I remember Ceylon when it was the most magical, most beautiful place in the world.<br><br>o<br><br>I suckled at Mother's breasts until the age of almost seven, running wild with my friends until hunger or thirst nudged me and then dashing back into the coolness of the house, impatiently crying out for my mother. Regardless of what she was doing, I pushed aside her sari and let my mouth curl around the unbound mounds of soft toffee brown. My head and shoulders burrowed inside the safety of her rough cotton sari, the clear scent of her, the innocent love in the milk that flowed into my mouth and the warm comfort of those quiet sucking sounds that I used to make inside the envelope of her flesh. Try as they might, the cruel years have not managed to rob my memory of either taste or sound.</p><p>For many years I hated the taste of rice or any kind of vegetables, content to live on sweet milk and yellow mangoes. My uncle was a mango dealer of sorts, and crates of them used to sit in the storeroom at the back of our house. A skinny mahout on an elephant would deposit them, and there they waited until another arrived to pick them up. But while they waited ... I sprinted to the very top of those wooden crates and sat cross-legged, without the slightest fear of the spiders and scorpions that inevitably lurked within. Even being bitten by a centipede and turning blue for four whole days didn't deter me. All my life I have been driven by the blind compulsion to walk barefoot down the difficult path. "Come back," people scream desperately at me. My feet bleeding and torn, I grit my teeth and press on in the opposite direction.</p><p>Dissolute and untamed, I tore the skins off the succulent orange flesh with my teeth. It is one of the most powerful images I still carry with me. Me all alone in the cool darkness of our storeroom, high atop those wooden crates, with sticky, sweet-warm juices running down my arms and legs, gorging my way through a heap of my uncle's wares.</p><p>Unlike boys, girls didn't have to go to school in our day, and except in my father's presence I was mostly left to run wild. Until, that is, at the age of fourteen, when the first drop of menstrual blood proclaimed me suddenly and distressingly a grown woman. For the first week I was shut up in a small room with the windows nailed shut. It was the custom, for no self-respecting family was prepared to risk the possibility of adventurous boys climbing up coconut trees to peek at the newly found secret charms of their daughters.</p><p>During my confinement period I was forced to swallow raw eggs, washed down with sesame seed oil and a whole host of bitter herb potions. Tears were to no avail. When Mother came in with her offerings from hell, she came equipped with a cane that I quickly found to my utter amazement she was prepared to use. At teatime, instead of her delicious sweet cakes I was handed half a coconut shell filled to the brim with hot, soft eggplants cooked in a surfeit of the dreaded sesame oil. "Eat it hot," Mother advised as she closed and locked the door. In a fit of defiance and frustration I purposely let it get cold. Between my fingers the cold, slimy flesh of the eggplants squashed satisfyingly, but in my mouth they were utterly disgusting dead caterpillars. Thirty-six raw eggs, a good few bottles of sesame seed oil, and a whole basketful of eggplants must have slid down my throat before the small-room confinement was over. I was then simply confined indoors and made to learn to do women's things. It was a sad transition for me. The deep loss of sun-baked earth under my running feet is impossible to explain. Like a prisoner I sat and stared longingly out of small windows. Almost immediately my long, matted hair was combed and plaited and transformed into a sleek snake down my back and my skin suddenly pronounced too sun-darkened. My real potential, my mother decided, lay in my skin. Unlike her, I was no Indian beauty, but in a land of coffee-colored people I was a cup of very milky tea.</p><p>A prized, precious color.</p><p>A color surely to be actively sought after in a wife, subtly encouraged in a daughter-in-law, and lovingly cherished in one's grandchildren. Suddenly strange middle-aged ladies began to appear in our home. I was dressed to the nines and paraded in front of them. They wore the shrewd look of diamond merchants. Their sharp, beady eyes inspected me carefully for flaws, without the slightest trace of embarrassment.</p><p>One hot afternoon, after Mother had tugged, pulled, and expertly rolled my stiff, awkward body into a great deal of pink material, decorated my hair with bruised pink roses from the garden, and dribbled me in precious stones set in dull yellow gold, I stood scowling by the window, marveling at how quickly and completely my life had changed. In a day. No, less. And without warning.</p><p>Outside, the wind rustled in the lime tree, and a playful breeze flew into my room, teased the curls on my temples, and blew softly into my ear. I knew him well, that breeze. He was as blue as the baby god Krishna and as cheeky. Whenever we dived from the highest rock into the waterfalls in the woods behind Ramesh's house, he always managed to reach the icy cold water first. That's because he cheats. His feet never touch the dark-green velvet moss on the rocks.</p><p>He laughed in my ear. "Come," his voice tinkled merrily. He tickled my nose and flew out.</p><p>I leaned out of the window, craning my neck as far as I could, but to me the shining water and the blue breeze were lost forever. They belonged to a barefoot child, happy in a dirty dress.</p><p>Standing there nursing my resentment and frustration, I saw a carriage stop outside our house. Wheels creaked in the dry dust. A heavy woman in a dark blue silk sari and slippers too dainty for her frame heaved herself out. Stepping back into the gloom of my room, I watched her curiously. Her dark eyes roved around our small house and meager compound, nurturing some secret satisfaction. Surprised by her strange expression, I stared at her until I lost sight of her cunning face. She disappeared behind the bougainvillea trees fringing the garden path. Mother's soft voice inviting her in wafted into my room. I stood pressed to my bedroom door and listened to the stranger's unexpectedly musical voice. She had a lovely voice, one that belied the sly, small eyes and the thin compressed l...</p></p><h2>When We Were Animals</h2><p><b>NOMINATED FOR THE 2015 SHIRLEY JACKSON AWARD FOR BEST NOVEL</b><b><br></b><b>A small, quiet Midwestern town, which is unremarkable save for one fact: when the teenagers reach a certain age, they run wild.</b><br>When Lumen Fowler looks back on her childhood, she wouldn't have guessed she would become a kind suburban wife, a devoted mother.

Together, they trace Sherman's rise from obscurity to become one of the Union's most famous and effective warriors.<br>Arranged chronologically and grouped into chapters that correspond to significant phases in Sherman's life, the letters--many of which have never before been published--reveal Sherman's thoughts on politics, military operations, slavery and emancipation, the South, and daily life in the Union army, as well as his reactions to such important figures as General Ulysses S.

His works combine the grand academic style with a sensuous delight in the human form and a feeling for colour and light. Leighton created the most elaborate figurative paintings of mythological, historical and literary subjects, as well as landscapes influenced by his European upbringing and training. As a powerful president of the Royal Academy, his passionate interest in painting revitalized British art in the nineteenth century and marks his out as a genius of his age.

But, he continued, what made France truly superior to its neighbors was the French passion for wine, which "contributed to the French race by giving it wit, gaiety, and good taste, qualities which set it profoundly apart from people who drink a lot of beer."<p> The commentator may have had a point; after all, write Don and Petie Kladstrup, it was a well-known fact that Adolf Hitler did not like wine. Still, their leader's teetotalism notwithstanding, the Germans showed no distaste for French wine when they invaded France in 1940. Indeed, among the first acts of the occupying army was to seize great stores of wine, sending tens of thousands of barrels to the Third Reich and ordering the conversion of thousands of hectares of vineyards into war production.</p><p> Some French vintners, the Kladstrups write in this enjoyable study, went along with orders. Many others, however, including the heads of distinguished houses like Moï¿½t et Chandon, engaged in daring and dangerous acts of resistance wherever they could. Some lied about their yields; others built false walls to hide precious vintages; and still others concocted elaborate ruses, such as sprinkling carpet dust into inferior grades of new wine to give it a musty, distinguished flavor. Not every German was fooled, and some partisans of the grape died for their troubles. But some Germans, at considerable risk to themselves, also looked the other way. The Kladstrups fill their pages with memories of the wine war from both sides of the struggle, stories sometimes somber, sometimes amusing, that commemorate those "whose love of the grape and devotion to a way of life helped them survive and triumph over one of the darkest and most difficult chapters in French history." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>nce fell to the Nazis and almost immediately the German army began a campaign of pillaging one of the assets the French hold most dear: their wine. Like others in the French Resistance, winemakers mobilized to oppose their occupiers, but the tale of their extraordinary efforts has remained largely unknown&#x2014;until now. <b>Wine and War</b> tells the alternately thrilling and harrowing story of the French wine producers who undertook ingenious, daring measures to save their cherished crops and bottles as the Germans closed in on them.<br><br>By rooting the narrative in the stories of five prominent winemaking families from France's key wine-producing regions of Burgundy, Alsace, the Loire Valley, Bordeaux, and Champagne, journalists Don and Petie Kladstrup vividly illustrate how men and women risked their lives for a cause that meant saving the heart and soul of France as much as protecting its economy.

Tour.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanRanke-Heinemann must have figured that since she was already in trouble (dismissed from the Catholic University of Essen for denying the virgin birth), she might as well raise a few more hackles by shattering another round of myths. Although at times her logic is a bit self-serving--Bible verses that support her theses are accepted as proof, while those on the other side are dismissed--for the most part, she cuts through the mythology of Christianity like a knife through butter. The Christmas story? Forget it. History is silent about a disruptive census that forced people to register at their ancestral homes (Bethlehem, in Joseph and Mary's case). And even if there was such a census, Mary, as a woman, would not have been required to go. No, the journey to Bethlehem is only a plot device--necessary to fulfill Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. The miracles performed by Jesus, according to Ranke-Heinemann, are equally suspect. Jesus himself, we're told, rejected the whole concept of signs and miracles, and even Paul says nothing about miracles. Because there are so many inconsistencies in the Bible, Ranke-Heinemann has no trouble finding myths to explode--Good Friday, Easter, and the Ascension, among them. Though her writing has the feel of traditional American skepticism (despite the numerous citations to German works), her intent is not to be a faith-shatterer; her gripe is less with Jesus, whom she believes sought and found God, than with his church, which she sees as weighed down with inauthentic cultural baggage. This is radical religious history at its most contentious. Expect interest and controversy. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>The Truth-Teller&#39;s Tale</h2><p>Innkeeper&#x2019;s daughters Adele and Eleda are &#x201c;mirror twins&#x201d;&#x2014;identical twins whose looks are reflections of each other&#x2019;s&#x2014;and their special talents are like mirrors, too. Adele is a Safe-Keeper, entrusted with hearing and never revealing others&#x2019; secrets; Eleda is a Truth-Teller, who cannot tell a lie when asked a direct question. The town of Merendon relies on the twins, no one more than their best friend, Roelynn Karro, whose strict, wealthy father is determined to marry her off to the prince. When the girls are seventeen, a handsome dancing-master and his apprentice come to stay at the inn, and thus begins a chain of romance, mistaken identity, and some very surprising truths and falsehoods.</p><p>Sharon Shinn is a journalist who works for a trade magazine. Her first novel, <b>The Shapechanger's Wife</b>, was selected by&nbsp; Locus as the best first fantasy novel of 1995. She has won the William C. Crawford Award for Outstanding New Fantasy Writer, and was twice nominated for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. A graduate of Northwestern University, she has lived in the Midwest most of her life.Grade 8 Up -Teen readers will be captivated by this medieval tale. Eleda and Adele, mirror twins, discover that they are a Truth-Teller and a Safe-Keeper, respectively. Truth-Tellers are incapable of telling lies and recognize when others are lying, so society relies on their unwavering trustworthiness. Safe-Keepers cannot reveal what is told to them in confidence, and they bear the burden of people's confessions. The sisters do not realize the ramifications of their gifts until their teen years, when romantic and political intrigue abounds, and situations become more adult. Their friend Roelynn, whose wealthy merchant father intends to marry her off to the prince, sows plenty of wild oats behind her father's back. She often drags the sisters into the fray, and the summer they are all 17, a chain of events is set into motion that changes their lives. Astute readers may predict the ending, but they will enjoy it nonetheless. Though at its base the story is in some ways a stereotypical teen romance, the author's use of language and her writing style elevate this novel. Shinn has a beautiful turn of phrase and a knack for writing a sentence that will stop readers in their tracks. The plot is episodic-incidents generally revolve around the town celebrations of either Wintermoon or Summermoon-but these festivals provide a reason for various characters to come and go from the inn that the girls' parents run. Fans of romances or mystical stories will revel in this offering.<i>-Cheri Dobbs, Detroit Country Day Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Considered a classic of children's literature, the book is among Kipling's best known works. Kipling began working on the book by telling the first three chapters as bedtime stories to his daughter Josephine. These had to be told "just so" (exactly in the words she was used to) or she would complain. The stories describe how one animal or another acquired its most distinctive features, such as how the Leopard got his spots. For the book, Kipling illustrated the stories himself. The stories have appeared in a variety of adaptations including a musical and animated films. Evolutionary biologists have noted that what Kipling did in fiction, they have done in reality, providing explanations for the evolutionary development of animal features.</p><p></p><h2>That&#39;s Dangerous!</h2><p><b>This audacious little book for children ages three and up is a catalog of "don'ts" sure to make kids squirm and squeal with delight-and parents laugh out loud.

This is the first comprehensive survey of the historical contributions of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the organizer of the convention and the author of the demand for woman suffrage, and Susan B. Anthony, her co-worker of a half-century. Through the long years of their leadership, Stanton and Anthony insisted on the idea that to be free and equal, women must join together politically, to control the impact of law and government on their lives. Although the right to vote was won more than ninety years ago, current political conflicts-over the ERA and abortion-demonstrate the continued relevance of Stanton&#39;s and Anthony&#39;s political message for American women. Most of the twenty-one selections from the writings and speeches of Stanton and Anthony that appear here have never before been available to the general reader. Ellen DuBois has provided historical commentary for these materials.

The enforcement of law is simple, quick, and inevitable: death by decapitation, from an explosive torc clamped around each citizen's neck by authority of a single man -- the Anome. For millennia Anomes have ruled Shant, dealing death as they see fit -- and none dares defy them, until Gastel Etzwane risks his head to expose the Anome&#x2019;s identity -- and end the tyranny of these faceless men forever. &#x2013; Jack King</p> <p>On the fringes of the Gaean Reach, the cantons of Shant on the planet Durdane are ruled by the reclusive Anome -- who coerces the population using explosive rings around the neck of every adult citizen. The Durdane trilogy (The Anome, The Brave Free Men, and The Asutra) follows the life of Gastel Etzwane, who grows from childhood in the dust of Rhododendron Way to become a musician of renown, and almost against his will, a man of action. When remote cantons are brutalized by the depredations of inhuman Roguskhoi, Etzwane goes before the Anome with a case for response. The Anome proves oddly reluctant to act, and Etzwane must stage a coup to turn Shant against the hordes. Eventually he discovers the sinister fact that the Roguskhoi tribes are pawns of the Asutra, alien elements who seek to bend all of humanity to a disturbing end. The Durdane trilogy traces the rise, struggles and ultimate triumph of Gastel Etzwane&#x2014;and through him, of humanity itself&#x2014;over alien subjugation. &#x2013; Joel Hedlund</p> <p><i>The Anome</i>, originally published as <i>The Faceless Man</i>, is Book I of the Durdane trilogy, and Volume 43 of the Spatterlight Press Signature Series.

The local scientific society is miffed by Marcus's publicity-grabbing theories, and definitely put off by his abrasive manner. Gideon detects an uneasy atmosphere at the dig. After a member vanishes and an unidentifiable body turns up, Gideon ("the skeleton detective" of Fellowship of Fear and The Dark Place) is dragged into the investigation by the police. He's also unwillingly involved with Marcus's great "find"that turns out to be a fake. Blackmail, academic hugger-mugger and more murder surface and Gideon and his wife are in dire peril. The characters and local color are only moderately interesting and the ending is rather tame, but the book is saved by Gideon's enthusiasm and Elkins's depiction of his neat "skeletal detective work."

Nikolai quietly shadowed them through the crowds, knowing they would never<br><br>notice a boy his size in the noisy throng. A dozen or more lan-<br><br>guages babbled above his head. He recognized all of them, and could make himself understood in most. Valletta was the crossroads of the Mediterranean, a place where Europe, Africa, and Asia met and exchanged their goods.<br><br>The men had the pale coloring of northern Europeans.

His talent for going unnoticed had enabled him to keep from starving in the years since his grandmother&#x2019;s death, though he seldom managed to be well fed.<br><br>The taller Englishman, a powerfully built fellow whose dark red hair was heavily streaked with gray, stopped to admire the silver trinkets of a local peddler. He lifted a pair of lacy filigree earrings. &#x201c;My wife will like these, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We saw better in Greece, Macrae,&#x201d; his companion observed.

He darted toward a nearby alley. In the rank, twisting backstreets of Valletta, he could lose these great clumsy oafs in no time.<br><br>The short man snapped several unintelligible words. The air tingled oddly, and suddenly Nikolai&#x2019;s limbs didn&#x2019;t work. Though he wanted to run, he could barely manage to hold himself upright. He fell against the bricks of the alley wall, his breathing rough. He hadn&#x2019;t felt so weak since he&#x2019;d almost died of the fever that killed his mother.<br><br>Macrae entered the alley and placed his hands on Nikolai&#x2019;s shoulders, then knelt so their eyes were on the same level. &#x201c;We mean you no harm,&#x201d; he said in fair Italian.<br><br>Nikolai spat at him, but somehow missed his mark. Macrae frowned. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t seem to understand Italian,&#x201d; he said in English. &#x201c;I wish I knew that dog Arabic the locals speak.&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai didn&#x2019;t bother spitting again, since it had done no good, but he growled like a mongrel. Dog Arabic indeed! Malti was the ancient tongue of the Phoenicians. Since it had never been trapped in an alphabet, it was the private speech of Malta, a mystery to stupid foreigners like this one.<br><br>The short man, who stood behind Redhead, said drily, &#x201c;Are you sure you want to converse with a rabid pup like this?&#x201d;<br><br>Macrae stood, releasing his grip on Nikolai&#x2019;s shoulders. &#x201c;Look at him with the sight, then ask me that again.&#x201d;<br><br>The short man&#x2019;s eyes narrowed for a moment, then opened wide. &#x201c;Good God, the boy blazes with power! When he comes of age, he&#x2019;ll be a formidable mage.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If he lives long enough and receives the proper training,&#x201d; Macrae said grimly. &#x201c;From the looks of him, he&#x2019;s halfway to starvation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019; talk &#x2019;bout me as if I&#x2019;m no&#x2019; here!&#x201d; Nikolai blurted out. &#x201c;Rude!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The creature speaks English,&#x201d; the short man said with amazement. &#x201c;His accent is abominable, but he&#x2019;s fluent enough.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a &#x2018;creature,&#x2019; &#x201d; Macrae said irritably. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a boy, probably younger than my Duncan. He&#x2019;s one of us, Jasper. His power has a different flavor from any I&#x2019;ve known, but it&#x2019;s real and has great potential.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;African blood, perhaps,&#x201d; Jasper murmured. &#x201c;There is some of that in his face and coloring as well as in the flavor of his magic.&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai&#x2019;s strength was returning, but he was still trapped between the two men. Why was no one noticing this scene? People walked by in the square just a few feet away and didn&#x2019;t even glance in the alley.<br><br>Mage. One of them had used the word. His grandmother had said it meant wizard or witch doctor. They&#x2019;d used magic to trap him, then to ensure that no one looked their way. He scrunched his mind up like Nona had showed him and dived under Macrae&#x2019;s arm in another bid for freedom.<br><br>A hard hand caught him again. &#x201c;Look at that, Jasper! The boy has shields strong enough to make him disappear from mage sight!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Either he&#x2019;s had training, or he learned that to survive,&#x201d; Jasper said thoughtfully. &#x201c;I begin to share your interest. But what&#x2019;s to be done with a wild lad like this one?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s start by feeding him.&#x201d; The tall man caught Nikolai&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Macrae of Dunrath and this is Jasper Polmarric. You have always known you were different, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai debated lying before giving a reluctant nod.<br><br>Macrae continued, &#x201c;We are also different in the same way you are. Or similar, anyhow. Among our duties is to help others of our sort when there is need. At the least, you stand in need of a good meal. Will you join us? If you look at me with your mind, you&#x2019;ll know I mean no harm.&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai had always been good at reading intentions, and he sensed no desire to hurt, but there was more than one kind of assault. &#x201c;Won&#x2019; be your whore!&#x201d;<br><br>Instead of anger, Macrae smiled. &#x201c;I have no interest in dirty little boys. Except when they have the potential you do. Is there a tavern where we can get a good meal and talk in privacy?&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai nodded and led the two men through the alleys, emerging by the best tavern on the waterfront. It looked over the Grand Harbor and was a favored place for ship&#x2019;s officers and merchants. Of course he&#x2019;d not eaten there himself, but he sometimes scavenged leavings at the back door.<br><br>The landlord scowled when he saw Nikolai enter, but the obvious wealth of the Englishmen saved him from being thrown out. Jasper paused to order food and drink while Macrae escorted Nikolai to a quiet booth in the far corner of the taproom. Nikolai didn&#x2019;t like being herded, but tantalizing scents made him willing to tolerate it. He would endure a great deal to feast on the tavern&#x2019;s best.<br><br>Besides, he was curious what these men wanted of him.<br><br>Macrae sat on Nikolai&#x2019;s right, Jasper Polmarric on his left. Though they didn&#x2019;t crowd him, it was clear they could stop him from running if he tried. Yet he still felt no danger from them. Only a deep, intense interest.<br><br>&#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d; Macrae asked. &#x201c;You can lie if you wish, but I&#x2019;d like to have something to call you.&#x201d;<br><br>Lying was no fun when put like that. &#x201c;Nikolai Gregorio.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Russian and Italian?&#x201d; Polmarric asked. &#x201c;Any African blood?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some.&#x201d; A quarter at least. Nikolai&#x2019;s grandmother had been pure African, but he didn&#x2019;t know all his relations. His grandfather had been Malti, and his mother wasn&#x2019;t sure who his father was. Perhaps an Italian, maybe a Greek, even an Englishman. Hard to say. The fact that his mother had liked the name Nikolai didn&#x2019;t make him Russian.<br><br>Conversation ended when a barmaid sauntered over with a jug of wine and three crude goblets. The tray also held a loaf of sourdough bread, a wedge of cheese, and a dish of pickled fish.<br><br>His hunger almost uncontrollable, Nikolai grabbed a piece of fish and gobbled it down while he ripped off a chunk of the cottage loaf. There was a knife on the board, so he hacked a sizable piece of the cheese and crammed it into his mouth, followed by a bite of bread. The sharp flavor of the goat cheese exploded gloriously on his tongue.<br><br>&#x201c;Not very civilized,&#x201d; Polmarric said in French, his expression a study in fascinated horror.<br><br>&#x201c;Give thanks you have never been so hungry.&#x201d; Macrae poured the red wine into the goblets and swallowed a mouthful. Though he&#x2019;d answered Polmarric in French, he switched back to English to speak to Nikolai. &#x201c;Eat as much as you want, but it might be wise to slow down. If you make yourself sick, you&#x2019;ll have an empty stomach again.&#x201d;<br><br>There was sense to that. Nikolai swallowed another mouthful of bread and cheese and reached for his wine to wash it down. The wine was a light table vintage, pleasant and probably chosen so it wouldn&#x2019;t go to a boy&#x2019;s head. That was another sign of their good intentions, for this wasn&#x2019;t the wine they&#x2019;d use if they wanted him drunk.<br><br>The barmaid returned with three plates of fenek. Nikolai dug in greedily. He hadn&#x2019;t had good fenek since his grandmother died. Less<br><br>hurriedly, the foreigners tasted theirs. &#x201c;This rabbit is rather good,&#x201d; Polmarric said.<br><br>&#x201c;Stew a boot in this much wine and it would be good,&#x201d; Macrae replied, but he dug in with enthusiasm.<br><br>Nikolai finished two pieces of stewed rabbit, then sat back on the wooden bench. With the edge off his hunger, curiosity returned. &#x201c;You say you are different. How?&#x201d;<br><br>Macrae&#x2019;s gaze flicked to the taproom, checking that no one was in a position to look into their shadowy booth. When he was sure of their privacy, he raised one hand and sparkles of light danced around it like sprays of golden fireworks.<br><br>He scooped up the dancing lights and poured them in front of Nikolai. Enchanted, Nikolai tried to catch the golden sparks. They faded in his grasp, a cool tingle against his palm. &#x201c;Magic,&#x201d; he whispered. He thought all the magic had gone from the world when his grandmother died.<br><br>&#x201c;We usually say power,&#x201d; Macrae said in a low voice. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a less- alarming term than magic. Polmarric and I are both Guardians&#x2014;members of families where power runs strong. Guardians exist in all nations of Europe, and we are sworn to use our abilities to help others rather than for personal gain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of magic&#x2014;power&#x2014;do you have?&#x201d; Nikolai tried not to show how hungry he was for the information.<br><br>Polmarric gave his companion a warning glance. &#x201c;Are you sure you want to say so much about us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He has to know.&#x201d; Macrae concentrated on Nikolai. &#x201c;There are certain things that all Guardian mages can do to some extent. Healing, reading the energies of other people, concealing, creating mage light. Most Guardians are also gifted in some particular area. I am a weather mage, able to shape the winds and storms. It is a common talent in my family. Polmarric here has a great talent for communication.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You say you swore to help people. What keeps you from becoming kings? Though you seem to live well enough.&#x201d; Nikolai glanced pointedly at the men&#x2019;s rich garments.<br><br>&#x201c;It is harder to become a king than one might think,&#x201d; Macrae said drily. &#x201c;Over the centuries, we have learned that it is best not to interfere often with mundane society because the consequences are unpredictable, and usually worse than one expects. Among ourselves, we maintain order by national councils of Guardians. Polmarric will likely become a council member the next time there is an opening, because of his communication abilities. If any of our number turns rogue and injures others&#x2014;<br><br>Well, we have mages who are gifted in detecting evil and enforcing order.&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai ripped off a piece of bread and soaked it in the fenek gravy. The Guardians sounded like a great, secret family that had both power and wisdom. Thinking of his grandmother, he asked, &#x201c;Mages are all men?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all. Women can be as strong or stronger than male mages. My wife is a very gifted healer. Polmarric&#x2019;s wife is the best finder in England, I think.&#x201d; Macrae paused as if deciding what needed to be said. &#x201c;Usually full power comes when one is reaching adulthood, but it&#x2019;s not uncommon for those who are unusually talented to show magical ability in childhood. My son, Duncan, has, and so have you.&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai stared at his empty plate, trying to grasp what he was being told. &#x201c;Why you tellin&#x2019; me this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because you seem to need help.&#x201d; Macrae looked tired, and Nikolai realized the man was older than he&#x2019;d guessed. &#x201c;There are too many homeless children in the world for us to save them all. But you are of our kind, so I am obligated to try to help you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One possibility would be to find you a place in a Valletta school so you would be fed and clothed and could learn to read and write.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know how to read and write,&#x201d; Nikolai said pugnaciously.<br><br>Macrae&#x2019;s brows arched. &#x201c;Impressive. How did you learn?&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai shrugged. &#x201c;My grandmother ran a waterfront boardinghouse. She cared for a dyin&#x2019; English ship&#x2019;s mate in return for him teachin&#x2019; me. Old Smithy took a long time to die.&#x201d; Long enough that Nikolai had studied numbers and some history as well as reading and writing.<br><br>&#x201c;You learn quickly,&#x201d; Polmarric observed. &#x201c;Your English accent has improved as we speak. Almost as if you can take the language from our minds. Do you read minds?&#x201d;<br><br>Nikolai scrunched down warily, wondering how the Englishman had figured that out. He didn&#x2019;t exactly read minds, but sometimes he would sense answers that people around him knew. Being with these men who spoke English did improve his own speech. &#x201c;Smithy said I was clever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A clever lad with power might not be safe in a local school, not with the Knights of St. John ruling Malta,&#x201d; Polmarric remarked. &#x201c;The Knights have a history of turning mages over to the Inquisition.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Macrae said. &#x201c;What you really need is a family, Nikolai. People who care about you, and for you to care about.&#x201d;<br><br>A family. Nikolai looked down so the foreigners wouldn&#x2019;t see the humiliating sting of tears in his eyes. His family had been small but real. With his mother and grandmother dead, he had thought himself alone forever. Thinking of what he&#x2019;d lost made it hard for him to swallow his stewed rabbit.</p><h2>Dreamers (New Directions Paperbook)</h2><p>The midnight sun illumines more than fishing and fjords in this remote northern Norwegian village. In fact, half-baked schemes and hilarity abound. Big Ove Rolandsen, telegraph operator, mad scientist, and local Casanova, trades wits, fists, and kisses with a host of quirky neighbors. He serenades the curate's wife and fights a drunken giant, but taking on Trader Mack, the town's fish-glue magnate, is a more difficult matter. Knut Hamsun, author of the acclaimed <em>Hunger</em> and winner of the 1920 Nobel Prize for Literature, renders the dreams and dramas of these townsfolk with a delightfully light touch. Robert Bly has written that Hamsun "has a magnifying glass on his eye, like a jeweler's," and <em>Dreamers</em> gleams like a perfect, semi-precious stone.</p><p>Knut Hamsun (1859-1952) was a Norwegian author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature whose best-known worsk include Hunger, Pan, and Growth of the Soil.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Norwegian</p><h2>Classic secrets of magic</h2><p>One of the best out of print magic books you can find.

Whether a form can be a mode is questionable, but that these yarns satisfy is undeniable. In &#34;Swellhead&#34; Kim Newman revives a paranormal investigator from other stories set in early 1970s London and sends him, now in his sixties, with a team assembled by British intelligence to a far North Atlantic island, where they discover a huge installation set to blast the world into submission to its creator, a version from another dimension of a member of the team. Call it absurd, but this is never-a-dull-moment, white-knuckle reading. Ditto Tim Lebbon&#39;s spectral &#34;In Perpetuity,&#34; the headlong impetus of which is powered by the desperation of its hero, who suddenly loses his four-year-old son in a mysterious shop and is told he will get the boy back only if he brings the shopkeeper proof of his love. That anyone could top those barnburners is incredible, but Lucius Shepard does the job with &#34;Hands Up! Who Wants to Die?&#34; about a smart Florida lowlife who lucks on a hot piece o&#39; tail and then a trio of rich scuzzballs from God knows where. This is Jim Thompson-in-Hell stuff. Funny, too. Ray Olson Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association. All rights reserved</p><p>The latest volume in this distinguished horror anthology series marks the first time that all three contributors have offered single novellas for their 30,000-word blocks of previously unpublished fiction. Each is an exceptional addition to its author's body of work and a fine example of how horror invites the blending of elements from other genres to yield imaginatively original hybrids. Kim Newman extends his long-running series on the paranormal adventures of secret agent Richard Jeperson and the Diogenes Club in "Swellhead," an architectural boggle of pop music references, '60s television programming, James Bond movies, subtle political commentary and nods to Jules Verne. Tim Lebbon's "In Perpetuity" morphs the horror tale into a quest fantasy with its account of a loving father challenged by an eerie curio collector to bring him "proof of love" in exchange for his kidnapped son. "Hands Up! Who Wants to Die?" by Lucius Shepard is a perfect piece of hardboiled supernatural noir that might have been written by Jim Thompson were Thompson partial to Everglades settings and plots involving "witches and spacemen and scum of the earth." It bodes well for future volumes that all three writers are from the generation that hit its creative stride in the 20 years since the series was inaugurated. Their stories are not likely to resolve the long-running debate whether the novel or short story is the better vehicle for the horror tale, but they will give readers deciding for themselves much entertaining food for thought. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rivals threatened her reign; England was a Protestant island, isolated in a sea of Catholic countries. Spain plotted an invasion, but Elizabeth's Secretary, Sir Francis Walsingham, was prepared to do whatever it took to protect her. He ran a network of agents in England and Europe who provided him with information about invasions or assassination plots. He recruited likely young men and 'turned' others. He encouraged Elizabeth to make war against the Catholic Irish rebels, with extreme brutality, and oversaw the execution of Mary Queen of Scots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Queen's Agent</em>&nbsp;is a story of secret agents, cryptic codes and ingenious plots, set in a turbulent period of England's history. It is also the story of a man devoted to his queen, sacrificing his every waking hour to save the threatened English state.</p> 40 Pages of Color and B&amp;W Illustrations</p><p>John Cooper&nbsp;taught History at Oxford before moving to the University of York.&nbsp;John often lectures on the Tudor Period and is a regular contributor to the&nbsp;Times Literary Supplement. He lives in North Yorkshire.The featured functionary in Stephen Alford&#x2019;s recent history (The Watchers, 2012) of Elizabeth I&#x2019;s intelligence service, Francis Walsingham here receives the full biographical treatment. In a fluid narrative tightly sewn from historical sources, Cooper portrays a man utterly confident of his religious righteousness and ruthlessly effective against those his sovereign&#x2019;s regime regarded as enemies. Raised in a Protestant household, Walsingham fled England during the brief Catholic restoration in the reign of Elizabeth&#x2019;s half sister, Mary I. Returning from exile upon the 1558 ascension to the throne of Elizabeth, Walsingham began an ascent in royal favor. It was as Elizabeth&#x2019;s ambassador in Paris that Walsingham witnessed the 1572 St. Bartholomew&#x2019;s massacre of Protestants by Catholics, a trauma that Cooper implies, by making it his opening scene, as an explanation for Walsingham&#x2019;s subsequently pitiless pursuit of Catholic recusants, suspected assassins, and Mary, Queen of Scots. In addition to the espionage that accounts for Walsingham&#x2019;s enduring interest to history fans, Cooper critiques his role in English settlement, or colonization, of Ireland. This well-wrought work will be popular with Elizabethans. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Love Attack Volume 5</h2><p>To avoid being expelled for her own unruliness, Chiemi Yusa must get her classmate, Akitumi Hirata, known as the &#34;Deranged Devil,&#34; to behave, but when she talks to him it turns out that fighting each other is the last thing they want to do.</p><p></p><h2>Country Diary Book of Creating a Wild Fl</h2><p>Book by Andrews, Jonathan</p><p></p><h2>Sixteen Hundred Lines to Pilgrims of the National Society of the Sons and</h2><p>This volume covers the lineage records of l,500 members new to the Society from 1953 to 1981 .

Some of the finest plays were inspired by the eleventh-century masterpiece of court literature, <i>The Tale of Genji</i>. In this detailed study of fifteen noh plays based upon the Genji, Janet Goff looks at how the novel was understood and appreciated by Muromachi audiences. A work steeped in the court poetry, or waka, tradition, the Genji in turn provided a source of inspiration and allusion for later poets, who produced a variety of handbooks and digests on the work as an aid in composing poetry. Drawing on such sources from the Muromachi period, Goff shows how playwrights reflected contemporary attitudes toward the Genji, even as they transformed its material to suit the demands of the noh as a theatrical form. This book includes annotated translations of the plays, many of them appearing in English for the first time. The translations are preceded by essays covering the history of each play and its use of Genji material.</p><p>Originally published in 1991.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

These books (from 1983, 1981, and 1980, respectively) are new to American publication, though they have been available in Britain. Each story is filled with broad physical humor and puns that work in English as well as in the original French, and virtually no indigenous or ethnic group escapes Uderzo's wit (at one point, the heroes are invited to bed down in a Bethlehem cowshed.). In <i>Asterix and Son,</i> Asterix and Obelix become guardians of a kidnapped baby who takes a potion and develops superhuman strength. In <i>Black Gold</i>, the heroes travel to Mesopotamia in search of more potion. In the <i>Great Divide,</i> competition between two village chieftains gives the Romans an opportunity to conquer. The cartoons are playfully round and brightly colored, and the architectural and martial details go beyond simple stereotypes. Asterix already has lots of fans; here are three new-to-America episodes that will please devotees as well as gather uninitiated readers with their mix of humor, history, and good storytelling. <i>Francisca Goldsmith</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Hard-hitting, provocative, and incisive, these essays consider contemporary composition and performance, the role of critics and historians in the life of the arts, and the fraught terrain where ethics and aesthetics interact and at times conflict. Many of the works collected here have themselves excited wide debate, including the title essay, which considers the rights and obligations of artists in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In a series of lively postscripts written especially for this volume, Taruskin, America's "public" musicologist, addresses the debates he has stirred up by insisting that art is not a utopian escape and that artists inhabit the same world as the rest of society. Among the book's forty-two essays are two public addresses&#x2014;one about the prospects for classical music at the end of the second millennium C. E., the other a revisiting of the performance issues previously discussed in the author's <i>Text and Act </i>(1995)&#x2014;that appear in print for the first time.</p><p>"Taruskin's work is a major contribution to thinking about music in the broadest sense. The book is lucid, powerful, varied, self-aware, and courageous. It is the very best work being done today, not just in musicology, but in any discipline."&#x2014;Michael Beckerman, author of <i>New Worlds of Dvorï¿½k</i><b>Richard Taruskin </b>is Class of 1955 Chair of Music at the University of California, Berkeley and is the author of <i>Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions </i>(UC Press), among many other books.</p><h2>How to Be the Parents of Happy and Obedient Children</h2><p>Four simple principles for raising happy and obedient children</p><p></p><h2>Yosemite</h2><p>A descriptive guide to the Yosemite National Park, written by John Muir, one of the founders of the Park, and its greatest champion. here are directions for walks and hikes, sketches of Yosemite birds, flowers, and trees, and descriptions of the incomparable landmarks of the Yosemite region.</p><p>In the spring of 1869, John Muir was looking for means of support to fund his explorations of California's Central Valley region. A ranch owner offered him a job herding sheep in the Sierra Nevada. As he explored the region, he jotted down his keen observations of the scenic countryside, and he eventually became a guide for some of Yosemite's most famous visitors, including Ralph Waldo Emerson. Muir documented these experiences in The Yosemite, first published in 1912. It is at once a vivid, accurate description of the land and a passionate homage to nature. <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is a facsimile of the 1912 edition and includes the original illustrations.&#x201c;Not only is [Muir] the author to whom all men turn when they think of the Sierras and Northern glaciers . . . but he was also . . . a man able to influence contemporary thought and action on the subjects to which he had devoted his life.&#x201d; &#x2014;Theodore Roosevelt</p><h2>95 Poems</h2><p>A collection of new works by the popular poet exemplifying his talent with words and sound patterns</p><p>E.

He spent three months in a French detention camp and subsequently wrote The Enormous Room, a highly acclaimed criticism of World War I.

The village of Makendha slowly marked the hours to midnight with a quieting of laughter and argument, a dimming and darkening, and a staccato punctuation of ending sounds&#x2014;the shutting of doors, the dropping of shoes, and the weighty hush of a house empty of talk but filled with dreaming.</p><p>One house kept vigil with a single glowing window. Behind the curtains of pale ivory gauze, gilded by the light of an oil lamp, an age-old scene was unfolding: a mother of the village sitting at the kitchen table, interrogating her adult son about his life, his loves, and his future. Because the mother was Paama, a woman known for quiet strength and infinite patience, the conversation was calm and loving rather than sharp and resentful. Because the son was Yao, also known as Chance, one of the undying who had become human more by accident than design, questions that involved love and the future were difficult to answer. Such is the lot of mortals who birth myth and legend in the midst of the mundane.</p><p>&#x201c;At last you come to visit your old mother.&#x201d; Strong, patient, but not at all above a little emotional manipulation.</p><p>Chance, occasionally called Yao, smiled fondly. &#x201c;I have been busy. You know that, Maa.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your trickster brother is the wanderer, not you. Why so vague about what you are doing? Who is she, this woman that you are working for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t keep secrets from you, Maa; you know that. But sometimes things are simply incomplete.&#x201d;</p><p>She studied him in the lamplight. &#x201c;I will try to understand. I know you have always been unique.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unique? You had two of us,&#x201d; Chance reminded her teasingly. &#x201c;Two undying ones turned human for the privilege of being your sons.&#x201d;</p><p>Paama shook her head. &#x201c;Silly boy. I would have to be very old and dotish to forget what your brother is, but you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are something beyond even him.&#x201d;</p><p>A mother always knows her child. Chance did not dwell on those times when he had been a capricious otherworldly creature rather than dutiful human son. And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there were days when he remembered as vividly as nightmare the moment when Patience, his elder and superior and as much a mother as an undying one could be, took him and unraveled his essence, all but unmaking him to make him human. Growing up Paama&#x2019;s son had been a long, slow awakening from near oblivion to deep self-knowledge. With Paama as his mother and the Trickster as his brother, mortal life was not hard&#x2014;it was even sweet. And yet it felt like it wasn&#x2019;t enough.</p><p>Sometimes things are incomplete.</p><p>The beginning of one person&#x2019;s tale may be for another a middle&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or an end.</p><p>All these finished and unfinished tales, with neither krik nor krak to bookend them, make a story and, more than a story, a history.</p><p>Paama took up the teapot, poured for herself, and offered with a gesture to refresh his half-full, cooling cup. He answered with a shake of the head and his hand over the rim. &#x201c;I must stay awake. I have somewhere to be later tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Vague again,&#x201d; his mother chided. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t act as if I don&#x2019;t know you. Give me something. A name.&#x201d;</p><p>Chance pondered. He knew that his mother worried about him, perhaps even more than she worried about his brother, although she would never say so. She had the same concerns as other ordinary parents. Was he happy? Was he prospering? Was there someone to take care of him when she was gone?</p><p>&#x201c;A name?&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;Very well. Her name is Miranda.&#x201d;</p><p>It was three in the afternoon at the Crossing Bar, a watering hole famed for its proximity to the Courts of Justice, and Miranda Ecouvo was discovering, to her deep dismay, that the day was not improving.</p><p>&#x201c;Murder by numbers,&#x201d; said Khabir Lucknor, her boss.</p><p>&#x201c;Playing doctor,&#x201d; countered Fernando Cavel, her colleague.</p><p>&#x201c;Reverse hangman,&#x201d; Khabir riposted cheerfully.</p><p>They looked at her with anticipation, waiting for her to add to the game. She gave a blank stare in reply and drained her drink. Bad enough to be depressed without dealing with their dubious, macabre humor as well.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Fernando, huffing the word out on a big breath to break the tense silence. &#x201c;We all have our ways of dealing with the stress. Bartender? Another one of these right here.&#x201d; He leaned over, his body one long, skinny curve sheltering a neat arrangement of empty shot glasses, and waved a finger to get the man&#x2019;s attention.</p><p>&#x201c;Smoke?&#x201d; Khabir said hopefully, but Miranda stayed silent. &#x201c;Another drink?&#x201d; He was the opposite of Fernando&#x2014;not fat, but slightly rounded with affluence. He had no favorite drink but kept to a varied range of mood-altering chemicals, used in moderation. He was the consummate professional. In time Fernando would match up to him.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said at last. &#x201c;I should go.&#x201d;</p><p>Four hundred meters of twisting alleys and uneven cobblestones led from the Courts of Justice to that convenient drinking stop. Eight hundred and forty of straight avenue, broad pavement, and level flagstones went from there to Lucknor &amp; Associates. It was an easy route for most. City professionals of a certain age learned how to be drunk at four in the afternoon and not look it. Miranda still lacked that skill, so she kept her head down and her steps brisk, hoping that would carry her the distance without mishap. She got safely to the main door of Lucknor &amp; Associates, safely inside, and safely, if not steadily, up the curving stairs. Her steps slowed, but she kept her face stern and made it past the receptionist with only a nod. Once inside her office, she stumbled slightly while trying to reach for her chair but managed to sit with dignified grace. She took off her shoes, put her feet on her desk, and drank two cups of sweet lemongrass tea from her flask. Near her heels, near enough for her to kick if she merely straightened a knee, her briefcase lay where she had thrown it. She looked at it with increasing disgust as sobriety slowly returned.</p><p>She picked up the phone, dialed, and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Miranda. It&#x2019;s a little busy here.&#x201d; The words were rushed, distracted. In the background, a recorded voice spoke in a charming professional lilt. &#x201c;Like many ancient walled settlements on the continental coast, the City has a history that dates back to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wish I were an ancient walled settlement,&#x201d; Miranda said. &#x201c;All that bombardment and danger in the past, nothing but serene meditation in the present, and only a little crumbling at the edges to look forward to in the future.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you drunk?&#x201d; the live voice asked in a low, suspicious murmur, clearly trying not to be overheard.</p><p>&#x201c;I have been drinking with Fernando and Khabir,&#x201d; Miranda replied with dignified precision. &#x201c;The case is over.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a pause during which Miranda thought she could hear the sound of a long, sympathetic exhalation.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get home early, put some soup on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Kieran,&#x201d; Miranda said, trying not to weep at the expected kindness. She swallowed and hung up quickly. Three quick breaths, and she had the composure for another call, this one internal.</p><p>&#x201c;Lucknor here.&#x201d; His speech remained unslurred, but then again, he had the experience.</p><p>&#x201c;Khabir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, m&#x2019;dear?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going home.&#x201d; On another day she would have asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Khabir replied simply. &#x201c;I believe I am too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Call Fernando&#x2019;s wife. He&#x2019;s still drinking at the bar. He shouldn&#x2019;t drive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take him home.&#x201d; That was fine. Khabir had a chauffeur, befitting his station as head of the firm.</p><p>When the call ended, she sat for a while, gazing blank-faced at the briefcase. She muttered:</p><p>&#x201c;All roads lead to the city at sunrise.</p><p>All roads lead from the city at sunset.</p><p>And I, who live in the heart of the city,</p><p>must suffer teeming days and lonely nights,</p><p>surfeited and starved on humanity.&#x201d;</p><p>It was terrible how tired she was, how much in need of a good bawling cry she was. And there was still the report to write. She dragged herself up and gathered herself for the day&#x2019;s last bit of professional pretense: the walk home.</p><p>The City could be beautiful at twilight, when the sky was still bright with gold and purple but the sea and land were dark and the sounding waves invisible as you went along the boardwalk. But early morning was lovely too, because the sun was still low and golden and kind, and you could lean carefully over the rope railings and look at the old cannons poking out of their recesses, thick-painted against the salt spray, never to fire again. When it was high tide, the waves smacked hard enough that you might have a good excuse for a salt-wet face when you straightened up. That was half the journey, the boardwalk.</p><p>The rest was less picturesque and consisted mainly of dodging traffic in the most tangled and congested thoroughfares of the City. Worse, it required alertness, an alertness that Miranda might feign but did not have. She wavered for a moment on the pavement, dashed to a central island between two lanes, and waited. It was the usual zoo: big omnibuses; nimbly buzzing scooters steered by risk-embracing students; small, fast cars driven by impatient young men; and large luxury cars with chauffeurs in front and sleek, comfortable bosses in the back. All were departing, as was expected of those who were not Freemen of the City, a privilege that neither wealth nor fame could buy. Miranda felt a wave of unwarranted pride for the accident of birth that had led to her ownership of the little town house overlooking the bay, not quite at the heart of the City but close enough.</p><p>A space appeared in the line of traffic. Miranda began to step out, and in that moment she saw something so shocking that a pulse of adrenaline overrode the remaining blur of alcohol, sharpened her awareness and immobilized her completely.</p><p>A woman appeared at her left hand. She was wearing the same clothes as Miranda, which was bad enough, and the same face, which was unconscionable. The strange twin smiled at her&#x2014;a quick, reassuring smile&#x2014;and then, while Miranda stood frozen in disbelief, she ran deliberately into the path of an oncoming omnibus.</p><p>It was midnight in Makendha, and two figures were in conversation near the well. This was a common enough scene except for the time of night and the nature of the individuals. They were similar enough in size to stand comfortably side by side, but after that all resemblance ended. One mimicked humanity in both attitude and attire, but his ordinary white cotton tunic and trousers, so like a peasant farmer&#x2019;s, contrasted with his fantastical bluish purple skin. The other made no effort to appear human at all, remaining a blur of wings and eyes spinning through a multidimensional topography accessible only to immortals and theoretical physicists.</p><p>&#x201c;We are sure you understand why we called you in to handle this situation,&#x201d; said the angel. &#x201c;It is the question of the human element in conjunction with the undying element. You are reputed to be an expert.&#x201d;</p><p>The undying one, son of Paama, who sometimes allowed himself to be called Chance, looked uncomfortable. &#x201c;Awkward. Very awkward. I would prefer if you dealt with it at your level, but I suppose you have your reasons.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the angel. &#x201c;We do.&#x201d;</p><p>It could have been a rebuke, a reassurance, or simply a mild joke. It was not only the tone that was ambiguous; the double meaning inherent in the angelic plural added another layer of intent and interpretation. Chance found that some angels, particularly those who were closer to the human world, accepted the limits of communication and enjoyed being inscrutable. Still, being inscrutable to him, given his far greater capacity for understanding, was something of a nose tweak.</p><p>&#x201c;Uriel will take over from us,&#x201d; the angel continued. &#x201c;It is their department, after all. Furthermore, they are a little easier on mortal eyes. And&#x2014;just a warning&#x2014;watch out for the Other Side. They are unusually invested in this. We think they are intrigued.&#x201d;</p><p>A rare expression of worry crossed Chance&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;You do not expect me to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, not at all. Only be aware. Be careful. It can be hard to tell us apart. You know what it can be like among the undying ones. We are not so different from you.&#x201d;</p><p>Chance gave them a disbelieving look.</p><p>&#x201c;It is only a difference in scope,&#x201d; the angel explained.</p><p>They flashed, fluttered, and vanished abruptly, having said all that was needed. Chance raised his eyebrows in instinctive surprise. Farewells were such a human habit, but one to which he had grown too accustomed. He shook off his feeling of foreboding and concentrated on the details of his duty, a trick that required him to focus all of his attention on a point in the present so that the probabilities would emerge clearly. What he saw made him smile. He understood why the angel had been so teasingly secretive.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it that sort of time already?&#x201d; he mused, the human idiom rolling off the tip of his tongue as easily as a line from childhood memory or a phrase from a future assured.</p><p>He knew where to go; the old sense of duty was like a compass, taking him to the opportune point in the paisley-patterned tapestry of space and time, avoiding that straight thread that was his human life. The City was his destination, a place well known to him in its incarnations as war fortress, pirate refuge, and living museum. He emerged beside an intersection that was tangled in a writhing snarl of human and mechanical travel trails. No one noted him, but he was alert, searching for a figure that would be so familiar.</p><p>There she was!

The introduction explains what symbols are and their importance throughout history. It outlines the coverage in the book and discusses the "catalog pages" that illustrate groups of 12 symbols from various traditions. The entries that follow generally portray on a two-page spread each, an item and its history, handprints on cave walls in Argentina, the breastplate of Aaron, ï¿½Vitruvian Man. Several entries address a type of item, such as tefillin (phylacteries worn by Jews), playing cards, or Fibonacci series. In many cases the book goes into extra detail. The summary on the Hindu elephant-headed god Ganesha, for example, is accompanied by information on Kangi-ten, a Japanese pair of gods that are male and female ï¿½elephants, and followed by pages on Hindu deities generally. Entries are accompanied by vivid reproductions of artworks. The accompanying captions provide basic facts on the items, though the descriptions are at times quite general rather than offering thorough explanations on the particular object shown. Since the spreads are fascinating but brief, some may wish for further reading advice that is unfortunately lacking. Still, this is a wonderful browse and a great jumping-off point for reports on history, mythology, and religion. ï¿½<b>VERDICT</b> Books on 100 objects of various kinds are common now yet usually address history rather than signs and symbols.

How exuberantly alive we should have felt to be freed, at last, from such a grim, lonely and stifling place. How pitifully delighted we should have been to be riding on a bus that rumbled slowly southward. But if we felt joy, we didn't show it. We sat, all three, pale, silent, staring out the windows, very frightened by all we saw.<br><br>Free. Was ever a word more wonderful than that one? No, even though the cold and bony hands of death would reach out and drag us back, if God wasn't up there somewhere, or maybe down here on the bus, riding with us and looking out for us. At some time in our life we had to believe in someone.<br><br>The hours passed with the miles. Our nerves grew frazzled because the bus stopped often to pick up and let off passengers. It stopped for rest breaks, for breakfast, then to pick up a single huge black lady who stood alone where a dirt road met the concrete interstate. It took her forever to pull herself onto the bus, then lug inside the many bundles she carried with her. Just as she was finally seated, we passed over the state line between Virginia and North Carolina.<br><br>Oh! The relief to be gone from that state of our imprisonment! For the first time in years, I began to relax -- a little.<br><br>We three were the youngest on the bus. Chris was seventeen years old and strikingly handsome with long, waving blond hair that just touched his shoulders, then curled upward. His darkly fringed blue eyes rivaled the color of a summer sky, and he was in personality like a warm sunny day -- he put on a brave face despite the bleakness of our situation. His straight and finely shaped nose had just taken on the strength and maturity that promised to make him all that our father had been -- the type of man to make every woman's heart flutter when he looked her way, or even when he didn't. His expression was confident; he almost looked happy. If he hadn't looked at Carrie he might have even <i>been</i> happy. But when he saw her sickly, pale face, he frowned and worry darkened his eyes. He began to pluck on the strings of the guitar strapped to his shoulder. Chris played "Oh Susannah," singing softly in a sweet melancholy voice that touched my heart. We looked at each other and felt sad with the memories the tune brought back. Like one we were, he and I. I couldn't bear to look at him for too long, for fear I would cry.<br><br>Curled up on my lap was my younger sister. She didn't look older than three, but she was eight years old and small, so pitifully small, and weak. In her large, shadowed blue eyes fingered more dark secrets and sufferings than a child her age should know. Carrie's eyes were old, very, very old. She expected nothing: no happiness, no love, nothing -- for all that had been wonderful in her life had been taken from her. Weakened by apathy, she seemed willing to pass from life into death. It hurt to see her so alone, so terribly alone now that Cory was gone.<br><br>I was fifteen. The year was 1960, and it was November. I wanted everything, needed everything, and I was so terribly afraid I'd never in an my life find enough to make up for what I had already lost. I sat tense, ready to scream if one more bad thing happened. Like a coiled fuse attached to a time bomb, I knew that sooner or later I would explode and bring down all those who lived in Foxworth Hall!<br><br>Chris laid his hand on mine, as if he could read my mind and knew I was already thinking about how I would bring hell to those who had tried to destroy us.<br><br>He said in a low voice, "Don't look like that, Cathy. It's going to be all right. We'll get by."<br><br>He was still the eternal cockeyed optimist, believing, despite everything, that whatever happened was for the best! God, how could he think so when Cory was dead? How could that possibly be for the best?<br><br>"Cathy," he whispered, "we have to make the most of what we have left, and that is each other. We have to accept what's happened and go on from there. We have to believe in ourselves, our talents, and if we do, we will get what we want. It works that way, Cathy, really it does. It has to!"<br><br>He wanted to be a dull, staid doctor who spent his days in small examination rooms, surrounded by human miseries. I wanted something far more fanciful -- and a <i>mountain</i> of it! I wanted all my star-filled dreams of love and romance to be fulfilled -- on the stage, where I'd be the world's <i>most</i> famous prima ballerina; nothing less would do! <i>That would show Momma!</i><br><br><i>Damn you, Momma! I hope Foxworth Hall burns to the ground! I hope you never sleep a comfortable night in that grand swan bed, never again! I hope your young husband finds a mistress younger and more beautiful than you! I hope he gives you the hell you deserve!</i><br><br>Carrie turned to whisper: "Cathy, I don't feel so good. My stomach, it feels funny...." I was seized by fear. Her small face seemed unnaturally pale; her hair, once so bright and shining, hung in dull, lank strings. Her voice was merely a weak whisper.<br><br>"Darling, darling." I comforted and then kissed her. "Hang on. We're taking you to a doctor soon. It won't be so long before we reach Florida and there we'll never be locked up."<br><br>Carrie slumped in my arms as I miserably stared out at the dangling Spanish moss that indicated we were now in South Carolina. We still had to pass through Georgia...It would be a long time before we arrived in Sarasota. Violently Carrie jerked upright and began to choke and retch.<br><br>I'd judiciously stuffed my pockets with paper napkins during our last rest break, so I was able to clean up Carrie. I handed her over to Chris so I could kneel on the floor to clean up the rest. Chris slid over to the window and tried to force it open to throw out the sodden paper napkins. The window refused to budge no matter how hard he pushed and shoved. Carrie began to cry.<br><br>"Put the napkins in the crevice between the seat and the side of the bus," whispered Chris, but that keeneyed bus driver must have been watching through his rear-view mirror, for he bellowed out, "You kids back there -- get rid of that stinking mess some other way!" What other way but to take everything from the outside pocket of Chris's Polaroid camera case, which I was using as a purse, and stuff the smelly napkins in there.<br><br>"I'm sorry," sobbed Carrie as she clung desperately to Chris. "I didn't mean to do it. Will they put us in jail now?"<br><br>"No, of course not," said Chris in his fatherly way. "In less than two hours we'll be in Florida. Just try to hang on until then. If we get off now we'll lose the money we've paid for our tickets, and we don't have much money to waste."<br><br>Carrie began to whimper and tremble. I felt her forehead and it was clammy, and now her face wasn't just pale, but white! Like Cory's before he had died.<br><br>I prayed that just once God would have some mercy on us. Hadn't we endured enough? Did it have to go on and on? While I hesitated with the squeamish desire to vomit myself, Carrie let go again. I couldn't believe she had anything left. I sagged against Chris while Carrie went limp in his arms and looked heartbreakingly near unconsciousness. "I think she's going into shock," whispered Chris, his face almost as pale as Carrie's.<br><br>This was when a mean, heartless passenger really began to complain, and loudly, so the compassionate ones looked embarrassed and undecided as to what to do to help us. Chris's eyes met mine. He asked a mute question -- what were we to do next?<br><br>I was beginning to panic. Then, down the aisle, swaying from side to side as she advanced toward us, came that huge black woman smiling at us reassuringly. She had paper bags with her which she held for me to drop the smelly napkins in. With gestures but no words she patted my shoulder, chucked Carrie under the chin and then handed me a handful of rags taken from one of her bundles. "Thank you," I whispered, and smiled weakly as I did a better job of cleaning myself, Carrie and Chris. She took the rags and stuffed them in the bag, then stood back as if to protect us.<br><br>Full of gratitude, I smiled at the very, very fat woman who filled the aisle with her brilliantly gowned body. She winked, then smiled back.<br><br>"Cathy," said Chris, his expression more worried than before, "we've, got to get Carrie to a doctor, and soon!"<br><br>"But we've paid our way to Sarasota!"<br><br>"I know, but this is an emergency."<br><br>Our benefactor smiled reassuringly, then she leaned over to peer into Carrie's face. She put her large black hand to Carrie's clammy brow, then put her fingers to her pulse. She made some gestures with her hands which puzzled me, but Chris said, "She must not be able to talk, Cathy. Those are the signs deaf people make." I shrugged to tell her we didn't understand her signs. She frowned, then whipped from a dress pocket beneath a heavy red sweater she wore a pad of multicolored sheets of notepaper and very swiftly she wrote a note which she handed to me.<br><br><i>My name Henrietta Beech, she'd written, Can hear, but no talk. Little girl is very, very sick and need good doctor.</i> I read this, then looked at her hoping she'd have more information. "Do you know of a good doctor?" I asked. She nodded vigorously, then quickly dashed off another green note. <i>Your good fortune I be on your bus, and can take you to my own doctor-son who is very best doctor.</i><br><br>"Good golly," murmured Chris when I handed him the note, "we sure must be under a lucky star to have someone to direct us to such a doctor."<br><br>"Look here, driver," yelled the meanest man on the bus. "Get that sick kid to a hospital! Damned if I paid my good money to ride on a stinking bus!"<br><br>The other passengers looked at him with disapproval, and I could see in the rear-view mirror that the driver's face flushed with anger, or perhaps it was humiliation. In the mirror our eyes met. He lamely called to me. "I'm sorry but I've got a wife and five kids and if I don't keep my schedules, then my wife and kids won't eat, because I'll be out of a job." Mutely I pleaded with my eyes, making him mumble to himself, "Damn Sundays. Let the week days go by just fine, then comes Sunday, damn Sundays."<br><br>This was when Henrietta Beech seemed to have heard enough. Again she picked up her pencil and notepad and wrote. This note she showed to me.<br><br><i>Okay, man in driver's seat who hates Sundays. Keep on ignoring little sick girl, and her parents will sue big shot bus owners for two million!</i><br><br>No sooner had Chris had the chance to skim this note than she was waddling up the aisle and she pushed the note into the driver's face. Impatiently he shoved it away, but she thrust it forward again, and this time he made an attempt to read it while keeping one eye on the traffic.<br><br>"Oh, God," sighed the driver whose face I could clearly see in the mirror. "The nearest hospital is twenty miles off my route."<br><br>Both Chris and I watched, fascinated, as the mammoth black lady made gestures and signals that left the driver as frustrated as we had been. Once again she had to write a note, and whatever she wrote in that one soon had him turning the bus off the wide highway onto a side road that led into a city named Clairmont. Henrietta Beech stayed with the driver, obviously giving him instructions, but she took the time to look back at us and shine on us a brilliant smile, assuring us that everything would be just fine.<br><br>Soon we were rolling along quiet, wide streets with trees that arched gracefully overhead. The houses I stared at were large, aristocratic, with verandas and towering cupolas. Though in the mountains of Virginia it had already snowed once or twice, autumn had not yet laid a frosty hand here. The maples, beeches, oaks and magnolias still held most of their summer leaves, and a few flowers still bloomed.<br><br>The bus driver didn't think Henrietta Beech was directing him right, and to be honest I didn't think she was either. Really, they didn't put medical buildings on this kind of residential street. But just as I was beginning to get worried, the bus jerked to a sudden halt in front of a big white house perched on a low, gentle hill and surrounded by spacious lawns and flower beds.<br><br>"You kids!" the bus driver bellowed back to us, "pack your gear, turn in your tickets for a refund, or use them before the time limit expires!" Then quickly he was out of the bus and opening up the locked underbelly, and from there he pulled out forty or so suitcases before he came to our two. I slung Cory's guitar and banjo over my shoulders, as Chris very gently, and with a great deal of tenderness, lifted Carrie in his arms.<br><br>Like a fat mother hen, Henrietta Beech hustled us up the long brick walk to the front veranda and there I hesitated, staring at the house, the double black doors. To the right a small sign read FOR PATIENTS ONLY. This was obviously a doctor who had offices in his own home. Our two suitcases were left back in the shade near the concrete sidewalk while I scanned the veranda to spy a man sleeping in a white wicker chair. Our good Samaritan approached him with a wide smile before she gently touched him on the arm, and when he still slept on she gestured for us to advance and speak for ourselves. Next she pointed to the house, and made signals to indicate she had to get inside and prepare a meal for us to eat.<br><br>I wished she'd stayed to introduce us, to explain why we were on his porch on Sunday. Even as Chris and I stole on cautious pussywillow feet toward him, even as I filled with fear I was sniffing the air filled with the scent of roses and feeling that I'd been here before and knew this place. This fresh air perfumed with roses was not the kind of air I'd grown to expect as the kind deemed worthy for such as me. "It's Sunday, damn Sunday," I whispered to Chris, "and that doctor may not appreciate our being here."<br><br>"He's a doctor," said Chris, "and he's used to having his spare time robbed...but <i>you</i> can wake him up."<br><br>Slowly I approached. He was a large man wearing a pale gray suit with a white carnation in his buttonhole. His long legs were stretched out and lifted to the top of the balustrade. He looked rather elegant, even sprawled out as he was with his hands dangling over the arms of the chair. He appeared so comfortable it seemed a terrible pity to awaken him and put him back on duty.<br><br>"Are you Dr. Paul Sheffield?" asked Chris who had read the sign with the doctor's name. Carrie lay in his arms with her neck arched backwards, her eyes closed and her long golden hair waving in the soft, warm breezes. Reluctantly the doctor came awake. He stared at us long moments, as if disbelieving his eyes. I knew we looked strange in our many layers of clothing. He shook his head as if trying to focus his eyes, and such beautiful hazel eyes they were, bejeweled with flecks of blue, green and gold on soft brown. Those remarkable eyes drank me in, then swallowed me down. He appeared dazzled, slightly drunk, and much too sleepy to put on his customary professional mask that would keep him from darting his eyes from my face to my breasts, then to my legs before he scanned slowly upward. And again he was hypnotized by my face, my hair. It was hair that was far too long, I knew that, and it was clumsily cut on top, and too pale and fragile on the ends.<br><br>"You are the doctor, aren't you?" demanded Chris.<br><br>"Yes, of course. I'm Dr. Sheffield," he finally said, now turning his attention to Chris and Carrie. Surprisingly graceful and quick, he lifted his legs from the railing, rose to his feet to tower above us, ran long fingers through the mop of his dark hair, and then stepped closer to peer down into Carrie's small, white face. He pa...</p><h2>Cecily Brown: Shipwreck Drawings</h2><p><p>As a university art gallery with a collection that spans 1500 years, the past holds a very physical presence and is a constant companion in all of our work. Our commitment to the best in artistic practice of the current moment, alongside our academic investigation and curatorial exploration of the objects of the past, enables a dynamic and critical relationship to exist between the two.<br><br>These extraordinary works by Cecily Brown, of wrecked ships, frantic and prone bodies, carefully illuminate the tensions between the past and the present. Taking inspiration from Delacroix&#x2019;s shipwreck paintings, as well as one of the most feted paintings in the world; Gï¿½ricault&#x2019;s, The Raft of the Medusa, 1818&#x2013;19.<br><br>Of course, these drawings also push to the forefront of our minds the images we see everyday on our screens, of shipwrecked refugees attempting, and failing, to make their own sea voyages. At this moment it seems more important than ever for galleries to show work that draws our attention to images and stories that we think we know so well and need not or cannot, look at or think of again.<br><br>This would be impossible without the work of artists such as Cecily and we would like to thank her for her generosity in loaning her drawings to the Whitworth and for her productive, artistic insight that will have such an e ect on our visitors. Exhibitions such as these are always the result of connections, conversations and friendships and we are indebted rstly to Thomas Dane for bringing these works to our attention and his support for the exhibition. Our heartfelt thanks are also due to Karsten Schubert, and all at Ridinghouse for this wonderful book. </p></p><p></p><h2>Legacy of the Sacred Harp</h2><p>Sacred Harp music or shape-note singing is as old as America itself. The term sacred harp refers to the human voice. Brought to this continent by the settlers of Jamestown, this style of singing is also known as &#x201c;fasola.&#x201d; In <i>Legacy of the Sacred Harp</i>, author Chloe Webb follows the history of this musical form back four hundred years, and in the process uncovers the harrowing legacy of her Dumas family line. The journey begins in contemporary Texas with an overlooked but historically rich family heirloom, a tattered 1869 edition of The Sacred Harp songbook.<br>Traveling across the South and sifting through undiscovered family history, Webb sets out on a personal quest to reconnect with her ancestors who composed, sang, and lived by the words of Sacred Harp music. Her research irreversibly transforms her rose-colored view of her heritage and brings endearing characters to life as the reality of the effects of slavery on Southern plantation life, the thriving tobacco industry, and the Civil War are revisited through the lens of the Dumas family. Most notably, Webb&#x2019;s original research unearths the person of Ralph Freeman, freed slave and pastor of a pre-Civil War white Southern church.<br>Wringing history from boxes of keepsakes, lively interviews, dusty archival libraries, and church records, Webb keeps Sacred Harp lyrics ringing in readers&#x2019; ears, allowing the poetry to illuminate the lessons and trials of the past. The choral shape-note music of the Sacred Harp whispers to us of the past, of the religious persecution that brought this music to our shores, and how the voices of contemporary Sacred Harp singers still ring out the unchanged lyrics across the South, the music pulling the past into our present.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>CHLOE&nbsp;WEBB has been singing all her life, from kindergarten music class, to church soloist, to a short stint as a professional singer, and now in a Fort Worth church choir. An award-winning ASID designer, Webb was more at home in high-rise buildings of Dallas than in one-room country churches with no air conditioning, where she and her husband Doug now spend some of their happiest hours. Now in retirement, Chloe and Doug Webb attend every Sacred Harp singing they can fit into their calendar, traveling from coast to coast.<p>Chloe Webb, thank you so much for writing this book! I got it yesterday, started it yesterday afternoon and finished it this morning. What a really great 400-year slice of American history; it reads like an exciting novel, except that it's all factual. You've really brought to life so many things that have somehow remained insistently dull in textbooks. I especially admire your determination to track down your people, no matter who, where, or what they were. Not surprisingly, it makes a tremendously rich tapestry, and you can be proud not only of the people, but also your part in sharing their stories with all of us. It's a wonderful piece of work.<br><br>Judy Hauff&#x2014;Sacred Harp composer</p> (Judy Hauff <i>email to author</i> 2010-11-09)</p><h2>Bouzouki Technique</h2><p>The Bouzouki is a string instrument, originally created in Greece in the late 20s. It belongs to the the long neck lutes category, and its roots are to be found in more ancient instruments, such as the Pandouris, the Tambouras and the Turkish Saz. The Bouzouki body is round and is built with staves. Only in the late 50s the virtuoso Manolis Chiotis came up with the current four double string setup and with the CFAD tuning (from the lower string). He was inspired by a standard guitar tuning, actually bringing the upper four strings down a whole tone. In Greece the Bouzouki is both a comping and a lead instrument, so it is often played either to back up a singer or to play arpeggios, melodies and complex improvisations. The Bouzouki was soon played by many Irish folk musicians, and many Irish luthiers started to build their own version, blending the Greek tradition with their own. They created a new instrument called &#x201c;Irish Bouzouki&#x201d;, reminiscent of the ancient English Cittern. It is shaped as a drop, and the back of the body is at, giving the instrument a lower and deeper tone. Tuning is different as well: the GDAD tuning is the most popular one. All this manual is related to a four double string Bouzouki with the standard tuning ADAD (from the lower string). In spite of that it is the most popular tuning anyway, thanks to the character it lends to the instrument when comping a singer. You can listen to this sound as used by a lot of Italian composer : Fabrizio De Andrï¿½, Mauro Pagani and others.</p><p></p><h2>Born in Tibet</h2><p>A young monk describes his flight to India to escape Communist pressure and explains the Tibetan way of life</p><p>Chï¿½gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International.

From an early age he was fascinated by the strange beauty of its volcanic landscape of fiery furnaces belching out heat and smoke. As a child he often accompanied his father - headmaster of the local art school and desperate to find jobs for his students, for this was the Hungry Thirties - to the individual pottery firms and their coal-fired ovens. His adored mother and father are at the heart of this story and his older sisters who, as much as his parents, brought him up. Children made their own amusements to an extent unimaginable today, and his life was extraordinarily free and unsupervised. No door was locked - Poverty was everywhere but so were the Ten Commandments.&#39; These pages recall the joys of going to school on a minor branch-line - the 1930s were the tail-end of the great age of rail in England - and the eccentricities and ferocity of grown-ups in an age before political correctness. The book ends in 1938 as the 11-year-old author queues at the town-hall for a gas mask.</p><p>Paul Johnson, who was born in 1928 and educated at Stonyhurst and Magdalen College, Oxford, edited the New Statesman magazine in the 1960s and has written over forty books.

An outspoken and precocious ten-year-old, Rebecca is one of those rare characters who have truly become a fixture in the canon of classic children&#x2019;s literature. Rebecca&#x2019;s good nature and generous, passionate spirit have made her a treasured heroine for more than a hundred years. Now, to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of the novel&#x2019;s original publication, Houghton MiVlin is proud to reissue Rebecca&#x2019;s story in this new and unabridged edition with a special introduction by Newbery Honorwinning author, Patricia Reilly Giff and luminous illustrations by award-winning artist Barbara McClintock.<br></p><p>Author Jack London wrote Kate Douglas Wiggin a letter about her classic <i>Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</i> from the headquarters of the First Japanese Army in Manchuria in 1904: "May I thank you for <i>Rebecca</i>?... I would have quested the wide world over to make her mine, only I was born too long ago and she was born but yesterday.... Why could she not have been my daughter? Why couldn't it have been I who bought the three hundred cakes of soap? Why, O, why?" Mark Twain called <i>Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</i> "beautiful and warm and satisfying." <p> Who is this beguiling creature? The irrepressible 10-year-old Rebecca Rowena Randall burst into the world of children's book characters (and her new life in Maine) in 1903 when storybook girls were gentle and proper. A "bird of a very different feather," she had "a small, plain face illuminated by a pair of eyes carrying such messages, such suggestions, such hints of sleeping power and insight, that one never tired of looking into their shining depths....

It reflects changing attitudes to childhood as well as the influences of technology and the invention of new materials. Remarkably, some toys have changed very little despite a change in materials: rattles once made of straw, clay, silver, leather and wood are now made of plastic. Greek, Egyptian and Roman children played with dolls, miniature houses, balls, spinning tops and pull-along animals on wheels. Kites have been flown in China for centuries. Dolls were either made from wood, fabric, leather or porcelain - or, for poor children, were just a chalk face on an old shoe wrapped in material - before the advent of fine sculpting by toymakers, Kathe Cruse or Sasha Morgenthaler.

To the residents of Toms River, New Jersey, the Marshalls were the perfect couple. Then Rob Marshall called to report the slaying of his wife. Sympathy poured in until disturbing facts of gambling, sex and murder began tearing the mask off Rob Marshall to expose a coldhearted killer. Already a bestseller, Blind Faith will have a full-page ad in People Magazine&#39;s &#34;top ten&#34; edition. HC: Putnam. (Nonfiction)</p><p><b>Joe McGinniss </b>is the author of eleven other non-fiction works and one novel.Rob Marshall, member of the country-club set of Toms River, N.J., led a freewheeling life of casino gambling, parties and astronomical debt. But Rob was also a civic leader and family man, so his three teenaged sons couldn't believe it when their father was put on trial for having their mother, Maria, murdered in order to collect $1.5 million in insurance and pursue a sexual affair with a neighbor's wife. This true-crime book is about the three boys' crumbling faith in their smooth-talking, high-flying father; on that level, it is often moving and heart-wrenching. It also concerns a suburban coterie's faith in a you-can-have-anything-you-want philosophy and the social and class tensions within one community. Rob's mistress was a friend of a high-ranking New Jersey political figure; drug dealing, loansharking and conspiracy were elements in the unfolding courtroom drama that McGinniss skillfully re-creates. While the story lacks the inherent sizzle of his Fatal Vision , it is absorbing nonetheless. The case took some bizarre twists, as when the wife of the accused hit-man went to live in the bereaved sons' house.

Life in Berlin was a cabaret, and Marlene Dietrich, Thomas Mann, Alfred Einstein, or Joseph Goebbels might be seated at the next table. The avant-garde thrived there. The mass media magnified the impact of everything from fads to political ideas. Subcultures and club cultures nurtured gender-bending fashions and lifestyles.

In the background beat the new rhythms of urban experience: the coming and going of the latest planes and trains and automobiles, the clacking of typewriters in vast offices, the jazz band that never sleeps. <i>Berlin: The Twenties</i> is a book for history buffs, travelers, and lovers of modern art and design.</p><p>Rainer Metzger is a writer and cultural historian, and professor of art history at the Academy of Karlsruhe, Germany.

She shocked the political system by winning election as Irelands first woman president in l990, redefining the role and putting Ireland firmly on the international stage. Her role as UN high commissioner for human rights, beginning in 1997, was to prove an even bigger challenge; she won acclaim for bringing attention to victims worldwide but was often frustrated both by the bureaucracy and by the willingness to compromise on principle, which reveal the deep and inherent barriers to changing the status quo.

A member of the American Philosophical Society, she is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Indira Gandhi and Sydney Peace Prizes. She is president of the Mary Robinson Foundation-Climate Justice, and lives with her husband, Nick Robinson, in Dublin and Mayo.Few would have guessed the tomboy daughter of Dr. Bourke of tiny Ballina in County Mayo, Ireland, would become a trailblazer. But once Mary Bourke decided she didn&#x2019;t have a religious vocation, she made iconoclastic choices. She studied law at the &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; Dublin university (the Protestant one), then headed off to Boston to study at Harvard in the tumultuous Vietnam era. She married a Protestant (political cartoonist, attorney, and, later, preservation-activist Nick Robinson) in front of a judge, not a priest. She built her practice as a barrister around civil rights law, representing clients like abused women and travelers (aka &#x201c;tinkers&#x201d;), spent 20 years in the upper house of the Irish legislature and then, in 1990, was elected Ireland&#x2019;s first female president. Robinson transformed that ceremonial position by joining European Union and United Nations missions to dangerous conflict-ridden areas like Rwanda and Kosovo. There, as in her subsequent service as U.N. high commissioner for human rights and her later work, independently and as a member of Nelson Mandela&#x2019;s Council of Elders, Robinson has helped define the respect and protection nations owe their citizens. --Mary Carroll</p><h2>Ashes to Dust</h2><p>Thora peered at the floor, but couldn&#39;t see anything that could have frightened Markus that much, only three mounds of dust.

You can&#x2019;t possibly believe that a pile of rubbish is the reason that he didn&#x2019;t want anyone to go down there before him?&#x201d;<br>The lawyer Thï¿½ra Gudmundsdï¿½ttir smiled politely at the man addressing her, an archaeologist called Hjï¿½rtur Fridriksson, but did not answer his question. This was getting out of hand. She was very uncomfortable; the smell of smoke and the ash hanging in the air were irritating her eyes and nose, and she was scared that the roof was going to collapse at any moment. On their way through the house to the basement door the three of them had had to make their way around a huge pile of ashy debris where the roof had collapsed onto the intricately patterned carpet, at which point Thï¿½ra had adjusted her helmet&#x2019;s elastic chin-strap to ensure that it was fastened tightly. She shuffled her feet and looked embarrassedly at the clock. They heard a dull thud from the basement. What exactly was the man up to? Markï¿½s had said that he needed a little time, but neither she nor the archaeologist could guess what his definition of &#x201c;a little&#x201d; was. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll reappear soon,&#x201d; she said, without much conviction, and stared at the crooked door in the hope that it would be pushed open and this business concluded. She glanced instinctively at the ceiling, ready to jump away if it appeared likely to crash down on them.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; said Hjï¿½rtur, pointing upward. &#x201c;If the roof was going to split apart it would have done so a long time ago.&#x201d; He heaved a sigh and stroked his unshaven chin. &#x201c;Do you know what he&#x2019;s doing down there?&#x201d;<br>Thï¿½ra shook her head, unwilling to discuss her client&#x2019;s plans with someone unconnected to the case.<br>&#x201c;He must have at least hinted,&#x201d; said Hjï¿½rtur. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been dying to find out about this.&#x201d; He looked at Thï¿½ra. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet this has something to do with pornography. The others think so, too.&#x201d;<br>She shrugged. That thought had certainly occurred to her as well, but she did not have a sufficiently fertile imagination to guess what kind of thing would be too embarrassing or disgusting to show to a stranger. A film of the homeowner&#x2019;s sexual adventures? Unlikely. Few people had video cameras in the 1970s, and she doubted that the type of film used back then would have survived the destruction that had rained down on the Islands. Besides, Markï¿½s Magnï¿½sson, who was down in the basement, had been only fifteen when the house had disappeared beneath lava and ash, so he probably hadn&#x2019;t been ready for much in that area. Nevertheless, there was something down in the basement that he&#x2019;d been desperate to get to before them. Thï¿½ra sighed. How did she keep ending up with these characters? She didn&#x2019;t know any other lawyer who attracted such strange cases, and such peculiar clients. She resolved to ask Markï¿½s what had inspired him to call her little legal firm instead of one of the larger ones when he decided to demand that the excavation be legally blocked. If he ever returned from the basement. She pulled the neck of her jumper up over her mouth and nose and tried breathing through it. That was a little better. Hjï¿½rtur smiled at her.<br>&#x201c;You get used to it, I promise,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Hopefully you won&#x2019;t have to, though&#x2014;it takes several days.&#x201d;<br>Thï¿½ra rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Damn it, it&#x2019;s not like he&#x2019;s going to move in down there,&#x201d; she muttered through her jumper. Then she pulled it down to smile at Hjï¿½rtur. It was thanks to him that things had gone so well until now, in that they&#x2019;d been able to get by without demanding the injunction. In any case, that would only have been a temporary measure since Markï¿½s and his family no longer had any claim on the house. The Westmann Islands owned it along with all its contents, and there was little point in fighting this fact even though Markï¿½s had made a concerted attempt to do so. He had focused particularly on Hjï¿½rtur Fridriksson, the man now standing next to Thï¿½ra; Hjï¿½rtur was the director of a project entitled Pompeii of the North, whose task it was to excavate a number of houses that had been buried by ash in the eruption on Heimaey Island in 1973. Thï¿½ra had had considerable contact with him by telephone and email since the case had begun, and liked the man well enough. He was inclined to be long-winded, but seemed reasonable and was not easily provoked. Hjï¿½rtur had been seriously tested, since Markï¿½s so often acted like a total ass. He had refused to give even the slightest clue as to why he was opposed to his parents&#x2019; house being excavated, had gone on and on about invasions of privacy, and had generally complicated the matter for Thï¿½ra in every conceivable way. After trying to reach an agreement but getting nowhere due to Markï¿½s&#x2019;s pigheadedness, in defeat she had asked Hjï¿½rtur whether he couldn&#x2019;t just dig up some other house instead. There were certainly enough to choose from. But that was out of the question, since Markï¿½s&#x2019;s childhood home was one of the few houses in the area built of concrete, and thus was more likely than the others to have withstood the cataclysm in any significant way. The purpose of the excavation was not to dig down to a house that was now simply rubble.<br>Thï¿½ra had already started reading up on how she might best obtain an injunction against the excavation when it transpired that Markï¿½s was only concerned about the basement of the house. Finally they could discuss solutions sensibly, and Hjï¿½rtur had proposed this arrangement: the house would first be dug up and aired out, and then Markï¿½s would be the first person allowed down into the basement, where he could remove anything that he wanted. After some consideration he agreed to this compromise and Thï¿½ra breathed easier. Markï¿½s had no trouble at all bearing the cost of endless litigation, since he was anything but badly off financially. His family owned one of the largest fishing companies in the Westmann Islands, and even though Thï¿½ra would never complain about being paid well for her work, she was upset about working against her better judgment, and toward a goal that would never be reached. She was immensely relieved when Markï¿½s agreed to Hjï¿½rtur&#x2019;s proposal; now she could start putting the final touches to the fine details of the agreement over how Markï¿½s&#x2019;s visit to the basement would be conducted, how they could guarantee that others would not be allowed to sneak in before him, and so on. The agreement was then signed, and they only had to wait for the end of the excavation.<br>So there they stood, archaeologist and lawyer, staring at a crooked basement door while a man who had still been a teenager in 1973 wrestled with a terrible secret beneath their feet.<br>&#x201c;Hallelujah,&#x201d; said Thï¿½ra when they heard footsteps on the basement stairs.<br>&#x201c;I do hope he found whatever he was looking for,&#x201d; said Hjï¿½rtur gloomily. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t think about the possibility of him coming up empty-handed.&#x201d;<br>Thï¿½ra crossed her fingers and stared at the door.<br>They watched anxiously as the doorknob turned, then incredulously as the door was cracked open only a tiny bit. They exchanged a glance, then Thï¿½ra leaned forward and spoke into the gap. &#x201c;Markï¿½s,&#x201d; she said calmly, &#x201c;is something wrong?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to come down here,&#x201d; came the reply. His voice sounded peculiar, but it was impossible to tell whether he was excited, disappointed or sad. The glow from his flashlight shone through the chink and illuminated Thï¿½ra&#x2019;s feet.<br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Thï¿½ra asked, flabbergasted. &#x201c;Down there?&#x201d; She looked back at Hjï¿½rtur, who raised his eyebrows.<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Markï¿½s, in the same enigmatic tone. &#x201c;I need to get your opinion on something.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My opinion?&#x201d; she echoed. When she found herself speechless she had a habit of repeating whatever was said to her, giving herself time to ponder her response.<br>&#x201c;Yes, your legal opinion,&#x201d; said the voice behind the door.<br>Thï¿½ra straightened up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you all the opinions you want, Markï¿½s,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;However, this is how it is with us lawyers: we have no need to experience for ourselves whatever it is we&#x2019;re dealing with. So there&#x2019;s no reason for me to clamber down there with you. Tell me what this is about and I&#x2019;ll put together an opinion for you back at my office in Reykjavï¿½k.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to come down here,&#x201d; said Markï¿½s. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need a written opinion. A verbal one&#x2019;ll do.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m begging you. Just come down here.&#x201d; Thï¿½ra had never heard Markï¿½s sound so humble. She&#x2019;d only heard him being haughty and opinionated.<br>Hjï¿½rtur scowled at Thï¿½ra, unamused. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you just get it over with? It&#x2019;s completely safe, and I&#x2019;m keen to finish up here.&#x201d;<br>She hesitated. What in the blazes could be down there? She absolutely did not want to go down into even darker and fouler air. On the other hand, she agreed with Hjï¿½rtur that they had to settle this here and now. She roused herself. &#x201c;All right then,&#x201d; she conceded, grabbing Hjï¿½rtur&#x2019;s flashlight. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming.&#x201d; She opened the door wide enough to step through and saw Markï¿½s on the stairs, looking pale as a corpse. His face nearly matched the white helmet that he wore on his head. Thï¿½ra tried not to read too much into it, since the only light was coming from their flashlights, giving everything an otherworldly ...</p><h2>Notable Black American Men: Book I</h2><p>This reference contains 500 alphabetically-arranged biographies that reflect a wide variety of areas of endeavour within the male African American sphere.

Cogley, a cranky old man who prefers books to padds and people to computers. </p><p> Now, once again, it's SAM COGLEY FOR THE DEFENSE! </p><p> The planet Aneher II sits in the middle of the Neutral Zone, and neither the Klingon&#x2122; Empire nor the Federation can claim it. Under the terms of the Organian Peace Treaty, any such contested colony world will go to the party -- Federation or Klingon -- which shows it can best develop the planet. </p><p> At first the two colonies live in peace, but it's a fragile peace, one shattered when Administrator Daniel Latham, the head of the Federation colony, is found murdered, and Commander Mak'Tor, the head of the Klingon colony, is found crouched over Latham's body, discharged phaser still hot in his hand. </p><p> When Lieutenant Areel Shaw of Starfleet is assigned to prosecute Mak'Tor, Sam Cogley volunteers to defend the accused Klingon. But when Cogley's own investigation provides the prosecution with its key piece of evidence and his courtroom tactics unexpectedly backfire, can even the galaxy's most brilliant defense attorney win the day in... </p><p> The Case of the Colonist's Corpse</p></p><p><p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> "Your Honor, I must object!" </p><p> Alexander Warren was on his feet as swiftly as if he'd been fired from a photon torpedo tube, practically leaping from behind the prosecutor's table to give emphasis to the objection he had just made. </p><p> Samuel T. Cogley looked over his shoulder at the imposingly brawny Warren and noted the prosecutor's face was as crimson as a Big Sky sunset. The older, decidedly not brawny defense attorney chuckled to himself. Even in the far reaches of space, images of Earth were never far from his thoughts. You can take the boy out of Montana... </p><p> Cogley could see the defense table from the corner of his eye. His executive assistant, Jacqueline LaSalle, had moved Cogley's pen off his pad of paper and put it on the desk, something Cogley would never do. He was obsessive about there being a place for everything and everything being in its place. Pens were not meant to lie on polished tabletops, when there was a perfectly serviceable pad of paper available. </p><p> He smiled and looked for a moment at Jackie. Her bright green eyes and wide smile practically jumped out at him from under her red-brown hair. Jackie was telling him their preparations were complete. Cogley tugged once at the bottom of his plain brown suit coat. It was time for the main event. </p><p> Cogley walked over to his opponent's table until he almost stood next to Warren. Side by side, prosecutor and defense attorney appeared to be a mismatch. Warren towered over Cogley's thin, five-foot, five-inch frame. Cogley didn't let the mismatch deter him. He fixed his pale blue eyes on Warren and spread his arms wide -- his hands open and his palms up to show they were empty. Then he turned back to Judge Faure and gave her a smile that seemed to ask, "Who, me?" </p><p> "'Must'? I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't realize that I was pointing my death ray at Mr. Warren." </p><p> "I beg your pardon?" Warren asked. </p><p> "You said you 'must object,' implying you were being forced into objecting. As I can assure the court, I have no mind-control powers. I can only assume I must have been pointing a death ray or some equally fearsome weapon at you." </p><p> The resulting outburst of laughter was even louder than Cogley had dared hope. Even as the judge struck her gavel repeatedly on the bench and demanded that order be restored to her court at once, Cogley knew his comment had had its desired effect: everyone in the courtroom was off his or her guard, unsure of what might come next. </p><p> Especially the witness. </p><p> As the laughter dwindled, Cogley looked back over his shoulder at the defense table and at his client, Aaron Cole, regretting what he saw. Cole squirmed in his seat, then leaned over to Jackie, his discomfort obvious in the way he moved. </p><p> "Ms. LaSalle, is it wise for Mr. Cogley to upset the court this way?" Cole asked her. </p><p> Jackie smiled, a look designed to give reassurance to the client. A look she'd had manifold opportunities to perfect. </p><p> "Don't worry, Aaron. When Sam gets this way, he has them right where he wants them. Just watch." </p><p> Once the laughter had ended, which was obviously taking longer than Judge Faure wanted, Cogley turned to her and spoke before she could. </p><p> "I'm sorry, Your Honor. It's just that Mr. Warren was being somewhat imprecise in his speech. Words are still, after all, our tools, our most important means of communication...when they are used properly. I guess I just forgot myself." </p><p> "If Mr. Cogley wants precision, I'll be more than happy to accommodate him," Warren said, his voice as edged as a Klingon <i>bat'leth.</i> Then he continued, putting a slight pause between each of his words, to demonstrate how precise he could be. </p><p> "He is asking leading questions of his own witness." </p><p> "A most hostile witness, Your Honor, if I may be permitted to demonstrate..." </p><p> Before the judge could respond, Cogley turned back to the witness stand and looked directly at the Kradian seated there. Sahirn P'Thall stared back at Cogley with a withering glare that the defense attorney would have called cold-blooded, if Kradians had circulatory systems. P'Thall was wearing his family clan's most formal attire, complete with the ceremonial tunic that proudly displayed the family stone in its sash. Cogley also noticed that P'Thall's twin eyestalks did not point at him, but away from him, a gesture by which the Kradian signified that he regarded Cogley as unworthy at best, contemptuous at worst. </p><p> "Mr. P'Thall," Cogley started to ask and noticed that both eyestalks turned toward him, even as the Kradian's glare widened so much that his eyes seemed to explode from his eyestalks. "Mister" was not a Kradian form of address; it was, in fact, an honorific that some Kradians found to be not an honor but an insult. If Cogley had harbored any doubts about his assessment of P'Thall's feelings toward humans, they were dispelled. </p><p> "Exactly what <i>are</i> your feelings toward Aaron Cole?" </p><p> P'Thall leaned back in the witness stand and sat up straight, stretching his more than six foot height to its utmost so that he could look down at Cogley. He did not even look at Aaron Cole, but waved his left hand in Cole's general direction in a gesture almost of dismissal. </p><p> "That <i>human</i> murdered my daughter Daleel P'Thall. How do you think I feel about the <i>grelth?"</i> </p><p> Cogley didn't miss the pointed emphasis P'Thall had put on the word "human." </p><p> "And are your feelings toward me, the <i>human"</i> -- Cogley put the same inflection on the word that P'Thall had used -- "representing Mr. Cole, equally enlightened?" </p><p> "You defend the <i>grelth.</i> Were it within my power, I would arrange for you to suffer the same richly deserved punishment that your client will endure." </p><p> Cogley turned to Judge Faure and smiled. </p><p> "As I said, Your Honor, hostile." </p><p> "You may proceed, Mr. Cogley," Judge Faure said, and Cogley noticed she seemed to be leaning forward ever so slightly. During his long career as a defense attorney, Samuel Cogley had earned a reputation for three things. The first was for being an eccentric, a reputation enhanced by his borderline obsessive compulsiveness, manifested most noticeably in his love of books and equally strong dislike of computers. </p><p> The second was his reputation for indulging in courtroom theatrics. This reputation was widespread, and Cogley was sure it had reached even here, to the vacation moon of Versailles in an out-of-the-way sector of United Federation of Planets space. Especially when his most recent courtroom theatrical, produced while he was representing Captain James T. Kirk in a court-martial, almost resulted in the destruction of Kirk's starship, the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise.</i> You don't nearly destroy a <i>Constitution-</i>class starship and expect the story won't spread. </p><p> However, it was the third thing Cogley was famous for -- doggedly getting to the truth of the matters he litigated -- that usually prompted judges to allow him to engage in those theatrics designed to ferret out the truth. Those judges who were concerned about justice, anyway. </p><p> Cogley had studied Judge Faure during the trial and was fairly sure he knew which type of magistrate she was. The next few minutes would either confirm or deny his assessment. </p><p> "Oh dear," Cogley said, "I appear to have lost my train of thought. No matter, I'll start at the beginning. </p><p> "Why here, Mr. P'Thall?" </p><p> "I beg your pardon?" P'Thall said. </p><p> "Versailles. A vacation moon for humans that simulates eighteenth-century France on Earth. It's primitive, doesn't allow spaceships or transporters or anything more advanced than horse-drawn carriages and oil lamps. Perfect for me, perhaps, but on Krador your family clan sells its engineering skills and technological expertise. Why would your family clan come to Versailles of all places?" </p><p> "We have started doing business with humans and felt we should learn more about them." </p><p> "Then why not go to Earth? Why here?" </p><p> "We have found we can learn much more about a species from the recreations it chooses than its usual routines. People tend to be more at ease, more natural when they're on vacation." </p><p> "How much could you learn about humans, when you rented an isolated castle on an island in the middle of a lake miles from any of the cities?" </p><p> "My family clan is quite large. Not only my wives and fellow husband, but the wives and husbands of our children accompanied us. The castle we rented had to be large enough to accommodate all of us together." </p><p> "Did your daughter recommend coming here?" </p><p> "She may have. She had been here before." </p><p> "In fact, Aaron Cole works here on Versailles and she met him here, correct?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Mr. P'Thall, isn't that the real reason you came to Versailles, to meet the human Daleel had fallen in love with?" </p><p> "It...was a consideration, yes." </p><p> "How did you feel about that?" </p><p> "I'm afraid I don't understand the question." </p><p> "Did you approve of Daleel's romance with Aaron?" </p><p> "It wasn't my place to approve. Who my daughter loved was her own choice." </p><p> Cogley walked back to the defense table and picked up a thick book. He thumbed through its pages for a moment, as if consulting it for some elusive fact. This was part habit and part theater on the attorney's part. </p><p> "Correct me if I'm wrong: the Kradians as a race prize both honor and family?" </p><p> "That is correct." </p><p> "And you didn't care that Daleel loved a human?" </p><p> "No. As I said, who she loved was her concern." </p><p> "A commendable attitude, Mr. P'Thall, considering her love for Aaron Cole cost your family both honor and stature among the other clans, as well as a good deal of business." </p><p> "It did neither." </p><p> "Oh? I thought you had arranged for your daughter to marry into the D'Quas, the family clan of your biggest customer, and when she refused, the D'Quas stopped doing business with you." </p><p> P'Thall didn't answer at first, staring pensively at Cogley, who had turned his back on the Kradian and put the book back on the defense table. Jackie then handed him several sheets of paper. Cogley took the papers, then turned back to P'Thall, who looked at him with fury seething behind his eyes. Then, very slowly and very deliberately, P'Thall said, "You were misinformed." </p><p> "You do that very well, Mr. P'Thall." </p><p> "Do what?" </p><p> "Lie." </p><p> Warren jumped to his feet and screamed, "Objection!" reaching a volume that startled the courtroom into silence. Cogley turned to the prosecutor and calmly said, "I apologize and withdraw the comment. For now." </p><p> He handed P'Thall the top sheet of paper. </p><p> "Mr. P'Thall, what is this?" </p><p> P'Thall took the paper and read it. At first all expression leeched from his pale blue face. Then the fury that had burned in his eyes consumed his entire face. </p><p> "Where did you get this? This was a private correspondence. I will have you arrested for stealing it from my office." </p><p> "Correspondence, Mr. P'Thall, has a recipient <i>and</i> a sender. In this case, you were the recipient. But after I explained to the D'Quas -- the senders of this correspondence -- what I needed and why, they were only too happy to supply me with a copy. They seemed delighted at the prospect of spreading word of the end of their dealings with you far and wide. To whoever would listen. </p><p> "The letter you're holding is from the head of the D'Quas family, your customer -- excuse me, former customer -- stating that after your daughter disgraced them by spurning the D'Quas marriage, they were canceling all their contracts with you, isn't it?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Come now, Mr. P'Thall, do you really think the jury could hear you when you're talking so softly? No matter, the record can reflect that you said, 'yes.' </p><p> "Now these other letters, which other senders were also only too happy to supply, all basically say that because of the manner in which your family disgraced the D'Quas, they were also canceling their contracts with you. Is that correct? Remember, answer loudly." </p><p> "Yes." P'Thall spat out the answer. </p><p> "So, when you testified earlier that Daleel's romance with Aaron Cole didn't cost your family clan either honor or stature or business with the other clans, that wasn't true, was it?" </p><p> P'Thall said nothing. </p><p> "Never mind, I think your silence speaks for itself. So you didn't come here just to learn more about humans, did you? You came here because Daleel was already here with Aaron. You came here to break them up, yes?" </p><p> "I -- we came here to remind Daleel of her duty to her family, yes. And we were successful. Daleel did break off her relationship with him. That's why he killed her." </p><p> "Yes, I've wondered just exactly how you got your daughter to break off her romance with Aaron. But no matter, you said she did and so she must have. After all, you're an honorable man. But what I really wonder is, how do you know Aaron killed your daughter? You didn't see Aaron kill Daleel, did you?" </p><p> "You know perfectly well that when my daughter died, my family and I were attending an opera here in New Paris." </p><p> "Yes, so you were. And how long did it take you to get to New Paris from your island?" </p><p> "As you yourself have pointed out, transportation on this moon is antiquated, intentionally so. I believe the word you humans use is 'quaint.' The trip took the better part of a day." </p><p> "So...you were nowhere near the island when your daughter was killed?" </p><p> "That is correct." </p><p> "Then, if you didn't see what happened, how can you be so sure Aaron killed your daughter?" </p><p> "No one else could have. Daleel was alone on the island. She didn't wish to accompany us to the opera and stayed behind. Flight isn't possible on Versailles, so the only means of getting to the island is by boat. The records of the harbormaster show that the only boat that went to our island was the one your client hired and that he was alone when he made the trip. As he was the only person who could have been on the island, he must have murdered Daleel, then fled afterwards. </p><p> "If you have any doubts about his guilt, ask him why he went into hiding even before we returned to the castle the next day and found Daleel's body." </p><p> "Aaron admits he went to the island. He says Daleel called him on his comm, asking him to come to the island so they could talk it out. But when he got there, he saw she had been strangled and was already dead. He panicked. He figured he'd be blamed and went into hiding. </p><p> "That wasn't the smartest thing he could have done. Made him look guilty. But you know what? I believe him." </p><p> Before the prosecutor could rise from his chair to object, the disdainful P'Thall made a sound half snort and half laugh, and began to respond to what had not been an actual question. Cogley had read his witness well. </p><p> "Your gullibility gets the better of you, human. How can you believe your client, when he was the only other person who could have been on the island and, by simple logic, the only person who could have killed Daleel?" </p><p> "Normally, I get to ask the questions, Mr. P'Thall, b...</p></p><h2>Wanting War: Why the Bush Administration Invaded Iraq</h2><p><i>Wanting War</i> is the first comprehensive analysis of the often contradictory reasons why President George W. Bush went to war in Iraq and of the war&#x2019;s impact on future U.S. armed intervention abroad. Though the White House sold the war as a necessity to eliminate an alleged Iraqi threat, other agendas were at play. Drawing on new assessments of George W. Bush&#x2019;s presidency, recent memoirs by key administration decision makers, and Jeffrey Record&#x2019;s own expertise on U.S. military interventions since World War II, <i>Wanting War</i> contends that Bush&#x2019;s invasion of Iraq was more about the arrogance of post&#x2013;Cold War American power than it was about Saddam Hussein. Ultimately, Iraq was selected not because it posed a convincing security threat but because Baghdad was militarily helpless. Operation Iraqi Freedom was a demonstration of American power, especially the will to use it. Ironically, as Record points out, a war launched to advertise American combativeness is likely to lead U.S. foreign policymakers and military leaders to be averse to using force in all but the most favorable circumstances. But this new respect for the limits of America&#x2019;s conventional military power, especially as an instrument of ffecting political change in foreign cultures, and for the inherent risks and uncertainties of war, may prove to be one of the Iraq War&#x2019;s few positive legacies. Record argues that the American experience in Iraq ought to be a cautionary tale for those who advocate for further U.S. military action.</p><p>Jeffrey Record is a professor of strategy at the Air War College in Montgomery, Alabama. He is the author of <i>Bounding the Global War on Terrorism</i> (2004), <i>Dark Victory: America&#x2019;s Second War against Iraq</i>(2004), and <i>Beating Goliath: Why Insurgencies Win </i>(Potomac Books, Inc., 2007). He served in Vietnam as a pacification adviser and received his doctorate from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He lives in Atlanta."With his usual crystalline prose and piercing analysis, Jeffrey Record penetrates to the heart of the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq, laying stark all of the flawed assumptions and logic. He demonstrates that the Iraq War has important antecedents in the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. The book is an invaluable contribution to our understanding of American national security policy."&#x2014;Steven Metz, author of <i>Iraq and the Evolution of American Strategy</i> (Steven Metz 2009-11-28)<br><br>&#x201c;Powerfully argued and utterly persuasive, <i>Wanting War</i> offers the best account yet of the folly and miscalculation that resulted in America's heedless plunge into Iraq. In crisp, devastating prose, Jeffrey Record exposes the incoherence of the arguments offered to justify this unjustifiable and unnecessary war.&#x201d;&#x2014;Andrew J. Bacevich, author of <i>The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism</i> (Andrew J. Bacevich 2009-12-07)<br><br>&#x201c;Why did Bush do it?

Young Ug is upwardly mobile, always on the brink of finding a better way, a nicer way of getting through life. He discovers that the fire that comes out of the sky can make dead animal bits taste terrific, but his mother thinks this is a disgusting idea and, she adds, &#x201c;Terrific? What sort of word is that? Don&#x2019;t you bring language like that into this cave!&#x201d; He invents the wheel but doesn&#x2019;t know quite what to do with it. What he really wants is a pair of soft, warm trousers. But how many millions of years must he wait for them? Ug&#x2019;s story is told in more than 100 colorful frames with speech balloons much like a graphic novel but for a younger audience. Witty footnotes explain some of the many hilarious anachronisms.</p><p>Raymond Briggs is one of the world&#x2019;s most popular and innovative author-illustrators. His award-winning books include the beloved storybooks <i>The Snowman, The Bear, Father Christmas</i> and, most recently, the critically acclaimed tribute to his parents, <i>Ethel &amp; Ernest.</i><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Ug is a dreamer. Foremost amongst his dreams? Soft trousers. When he balks at the stone pants his father carves for him ("I can hardly move"), his father replies, "Listen to me, Ug. Nowadays everything is made of stone. This is why nowadays is called The Stone Age." Briggs (The Snowman), with his trademark comic strip-like panels, follows Ug from boyhood to manhood on his quest for a more enlightened life, mining this rich vein of cheeky humor brilliantly. Ug's mother, the slyly named Dugs, believes that her son is headed for ruin ("He'll end up painting animals on the walls"), and the exchanges between the two frequently sound like a Monty Python routine (when Ug asks what's for dinner, for instance, Dugs replies, "Same as always bits of dead animals." "I wish there was something else, something nice," the boy says, to which his mother replies, "Nice! You're always going on about Nice!," and on from there). Ug's dissatisfaction leads to his invention of the wheel (he doesn't know what to do with it), his discovery of fire (his parents squelch the idea) and, as a grown man, he does indeed paint animals on cave walls. Briggs's pleasingly round characters and the muted palette of his softly shaded pencil and watercolor illustrations provide plenty of eye appeal, while a running tongue-in-cheek list of "anachronisms" (e.g., "Minute: [anachronism] No one knew about minutes in the Stone Age. Nevertheless, they were there all the time") adds to the hilarity. Ages 8-up.-- No one knew about minutes in the Stone Age. Nevertheless, they were there all the time") adds to the hilarity.

Thousands of Americans own purebred show dogs, and year round, local kennel clubs host events at which judges evaluate how closely individual dogs conform to breed standard. Ribbons and trophies are bestowed and points are accumulated. The ultimate event in a show dog's life is Westminster--held in New York every year since 1877--which attracts hordes of visitors and an international media bonanza. In 2005 <i>Life</i> magazine assigned photographer Kate Lacey to cover Westminster. She decided that instead of documenting the scene, she would rig up a seamless backdrop to make elegant portraits, much as Richard Avedon once captured glamorous celebrities. Though partial to poodle mutt mixes herself, on this assignment Kate became entranced by show dogs, and their exquisite grooming and acclimatization to attention made them ready subjects. After the assignment ended, she continued traveling to dog shows in a quest to photograph every one of the AKC-recognized breeds. Some of the dogs in <i>Show Dogs</i> are veterans of years of shows, some are champions and some are just puppies; but their achievements in the ring are not the point. With each portrait you'll just see the nickname given by the people who love them, not their official championship names, which convey their titles and lineage. The dogs in this book are like supermodels off duty, showing us a personal side in a candid moment. What we love about these dogs is not their fancy parentage and titles, but exactly what we love about every dog in our lives; their quirky and wonderful dogginess.</p><p>Kate Lacey is a freelance photographer who has worked on assignment for magazines including Oprah, InStyle, People, Fortune, ReadyMade, Craft, Smart Money, the New York Times, and Artforum. Her clients also include Rockstar Games, the Discovery Channel, Herman Miller, L Oreal Paris, and UPS. She has worked as a photo editor for the Village Voice, New York, and The New Yorker. Her work has been featured in the DoubleTake book, 25 and Under/Photographers and Catholic No. 1: Cats.

Tucked in a life preserver, she washed onto a sandbar as the craft sank from view. That first baptism began a lifelong relationship with a stunning and powerful river that almost nobody knows.</p><p>The Altamaha rises dark and mysterious in southeast Georgia. It is deep and wide bordered by swamps. Its corridor contains an extraordinary biodiï¿½versity, including many rare and endangered species, which led the Nature Conservancy to designate it as one of the world&#x2019;s last great places.</p><p>The Altamaha is Ray&#x2019;s river, and from childhood she dreamed of paddling its entire length to where it empties into the sea. <i>Drifting into Darien</i> begins with an account of finally making that journey, turning to meditaï¿½tions on the many ways we accept a world that contains both good and evil. With praise, biting satire, and hope, Ray contemplates transformation and attempts with every page to settle peacefully into the now.</p><p>Though commemorating a history that includes logging, Ray celebrates &#x201c;a culture that sprang from the flatwoods, which required a judicious use of nature.&#x201d; She looks in vain for an ivorybill woodpecker but is equally eager to see any of the imperiled species found in the river basin: spiny mussel, American oystercatcher, Radford&#x2019;s mint, Alabama milkvine. The book explores both the need and the possibilities for conservation of the river and the surrounding forests and wetlands. As in her groundbreaking <i>Ecology of a Cracker Childhood</i>, Ray writes an account of her beloved river that is both social history and natural history, understanding the two as inseparable, particularly in the rural corner of Georgia that she knows best. Ray goes looking for wisdom and finds a river.</p></p><p>JANISSE RAY is the author of <i>Pinhook: Finding Wholeness in a Fragmented Land</i>, <i>Wild Card Quilt: Taking a Chance on Home</i>, the best-selling <i>Ecology of a Cracker Childhood</i>, and <i>The Seed Underground: A Growing Revolution to Save Food</i>.

In this wonderfully fearless narrative, Ray takes her readers into the haunts of giant catfish and rare trees. Enormous blackberries picked in the Altamaha&#x2019;s swamps, and cancer clusters that include close relations who live near a nuclear power plant, illustrate as never before the link between body and place. In the generously personal prose we count on from Janisse Ray, we are renewed by stories of people who have begun to 'reconcile themselves with their landscape, with their home, and with each other.' And we see how, as they do, Georgia&#x2019;s irreplaceable 137-mile 'Little Amazon,' also begins to win.</p> (Susan Cerulean <i>author of <i>Tracking Desire: A Journey after Swallow-tailed Kites</i></i>)<br><br><p>In Ray&#x2019;s <i>Drifting into Darien</i> readers will feel the poetic beauty enjoyment, and power of paddling in Georgia&#x2019;s Altamaha River.</p> (Bob Edmonds <i><i>McCormick Messenger</i></i>)<br><br><p>An idiosyncratic and passionate book, <i>Drifting Into Darien</i> is Ray&#x2019;s own call to the river&#x2015;something between a poem and a prayer, a sermon and a scientific study, a memoir and a field journal. Opening with a week-long kayak trip made with a group of people in memory of the old rafting crews that floated logs down river several generations earlier (when there was still longleaf pine forest to cut), Ray mixes memories with modern-day observations and insight, and becomes a shaman and guide to the reader.</p> (Nicki Leone <i><i>BiblioBuffet</i></i>)<br><br><p>Ray, who danced nature writing into new and fertile terrain with <i>An Ecology of a Cracker Childhood</i>, introduces readers to one of the glories of the South, the Altamaha River. . . .

Each guide color-codes the city's districts or neighborhoods, making it easy for readers to know at a glance just where they are in the book--and where they want to go. <i>Eyewitness Paris</i> is typical of the series: a brief history of the city is followed by "Paris at a Glance" featuring the best museums, churches and parks; "Paris Through the Year," a description of the seasons; and "A River View of Paris" which takes the reader on a tour along the Seine.

At the back of the book is a lengthy section called "Travelers Needs" which includes extensive information about restaurants, hotels, shopping venues entertainment opportunities and special activities for children.

How does a girl answer questions about her family when her mom was murdered and her dad was once an infamous criminal known as Gino the Ram? <br>Beats me.

Maybe a modicum of freedom is lurking in my future. <br>However, I will miss Dario <i>so</i> much, and believe me, I know he feels the same way. <br>We&#x2019;re very different. I resemble Gino with my tangle of jet-black hair, olive skin, and intense dark eyes, whereas Dario inherited my mom&#x2019;s calm blondness. <br>Yes. I do remember my mom. Beautiful Maria. Sunny and warm and kind. Sweet-smelling with the smile of an angel and the softest skin in the world. She was the love of my father&#x2019;s life, even though he&#x2019;s had legions of girlfriends since her tragic death. I hate him for that, it&#x2019;s so wrong. <br>I miss my mom so much, I think about her every day. The problem is that my memories are akin to a frightening dark nightmare because <i>I</i> am the one who discovered her naked body floating lifelessly on a striped raft in the family swimming pool&#x2014;the pool tinged pink with her blood. <br>I was five years old, and it&#x2019;s an image that never leaves me. <br>I remember screaming hysterically, and people running outside to see what was going on. Then Nanny Camden picked me up and hustled me inside the house. After that everything is a blur. <br>I do remember the funeral. Such a somber affair. Everyone crying. Dario clinging to Nanny Camden, while I clutched Gino&#x2019;s hand and put on a brave face. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t <i>ever</i> forget you&#x2019;re a Santangelo,&#x201d; Gino informed me with a steely glare. &#x201c;Never let &#x2019;em see you crumble. Got it?&#x201d; <br>Yes, I got it. So I managed to stay stoic and dry-eyed, even though I was only five and quite devastated. <br>Ah, yes, fond memories of a screwed-up childhood. <br>Now the limo sits outside the Bel Air house, idling in our fancy driveway, ready to spirit me away to the airport. <br>Dario has on a sulky face&#x2014;which does not take away from his hotness. My brother might only be thirteen, but he&#x2019;s almost six feet tall, and once he gets some freedom, girls will be all over him. <br>It pisses Gino off that Dario doesn&#x2019;t look like him. He always wanted a son&#x2014;a mirror image of himself&#x2014;instead he got me. <br> <i>Ha-ha! I&#x2019;m the son he never had.</i> <br> <i>Too bad, Daddy. Make the most of it.</i> <br>Gino is sending me away to school because he&#x2019;s under the impression I&#x2019;m a wild one. Just because I occasionally manage to escape from the house and hang out in Westwood&#x2014;driving one of the house cars without a license&#x2014;does not label me as wild. It&#x2019;s not as if I do anything crazy, I simply wander around the area checking out what it would be like to be a normal teenager. And yeah, I have to admit that sometimes I do get to talk to a boy or two. <br>Unfortunately, one memorable night I was pulled over by the cops, and that was a disaster. When Gino found out he went loco. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sendin&#x2019; you off to a school that&#x2019;ll drill some sense into you,&#x201d; he yelled, having conferred with my Aunt Jen. &#x201c;What you need is an assful of discipline. I&#x2019;m not puttin&#x2019; up with your crappy behavior anymore. You&#x2019;re drivin&#x2019; me insane.&#x201d; <br> <i>That&#x2019;s my dad, so unbelievably eloquent.</i> <br>Marco is standing next to the limo, speaking with the driver. Marco is kind of Gino&#x2019;s shadow and a total babe. He&#x2019;s way over six feet tall, lean and muscular, with thick black curly hair and lips to die for. He&#x2019;s old. Probably late twenties. It doesn&#x2019;t matter because I have a major crush. He&#x2019;s handsomer than any movie star and major cool. Problem is that he talks down to me, treats me as if I&#x2019;m a little kid, which I suppose in his eyes I am. <br>I&#x2019;m on a mission to make him notice me in a different way. I want him to see me as sexy and cool, in fact everything I&#x2019;m actually not. <br>Our guardian emerges from the house. Dario and I have christened her Miss Bossy. She&#x2019;s been around for three years, and has given us about as much affection as a plank of wood. She&#x2019;s so annoying that I can&#x2019;t even be bothered to hate her. <br>&#x201c;Get in the car, Lucky,&#x201d; Miss Bossy says, fussing with her hair. &#x201c;Dario,&#x201d; she orders tartly, &#x201c;say good-bye to your sister, and make it quick.&#x201d; <br>Miss Bossy has been assigned to accompany me to Europe in spite of my protestations that I am quite capable of making the trip on my own. However, Gino insisted. &#x201c;You go, she goes,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d barked at me. &#x201c;When she delivers you safely to the school, she leaves. That&#x2019;s it, no discussion.&#x201d; <br> <i>Gino. King of the &#x201c;no discussion.&#x201d;</i> <br>Miss Bossy opens the car door and climbs inside. <br>Dario mouths &#x201c;Jerko!&#x201d; behind her back and starts kicking pebbles from the driveway toward the limo. They ping off the front of the car. <br>&#x201c;Quit it,&#x201d; Marco says sharply. <br>Dario continues scowling. Like I said, he&#x2019;s not happy I&#x2019;m leaving. <br>I run over, hug my brother, and whisper in his ear, &#x201c;Stay cool, don&#x2019;t let &#x2019;em get you down. I&#x2019;ll be back before you know it.&#x201d; <br>Dario tries to keep it together, but I can see the frustration and sadness in his blue eyes; he&#x2019;s actually holding back tears. I feel terrible. <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Lucky,&#x201d; Marco says, sounding impatient, like he really can&#x2019;t be bothered with this. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t wanna miss your plane.&#x201d; <br> <i>Ah yes, Mister Handsome, that&#x2019;s exactly what I want to do.</i> <br>I give Dario one final hug and blurt out, &#x201c;Love ya,&#x201d; which of course embarrasses the crap out of him. <br>Dario mumbles something back, and suddenly I find myself sitting in the limo and we are off. <br>Gino is nowhere to be seen. He&#x2019;s away on a business trip. <br> <i>What else is new?</i> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright ï¿½ 2014 by Chances, Inc. <br></p><h2>The University of Chicago School Mathematics Project Advanced Algebra Teacher&#39;s Edition Volume 1 Chapters 1-6</h2><p>Teacher&#39;s Edition wrap-around style Volume 1, covering Chapters 1-6 of the 2010 Student Text</p><p></p><h2>Old Mr. Boston deluxe official bartender&#39;s guide</h2><p>Old Mr. Boston was a distillery located at 1010 Massachusetts Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts from 1933 to 1986. It produced its own label of gin, bourbon, rum, and brandies, as well as a few cordials and liqueurs.

No book, at least in English, has struggled with the difficulties of finding texts, chants, or other material in the liturgical manuscripts themselves, until the publication of Medieval Manuscripts for Mass and Office in 1982.</p><p>Encompassing a period of several centuries, ca 1200-1500, this book provides solutions for such endeavours. Although by this period the basic order and content of liturgical books were more or less standardized, there existed hundreds of different methods of dealing with the internal organisation and the actual writing of the texts and chants on the page. Generalization becomes problematic; the use of any single source as a typical example for more than local detail is impossible. </p><p>Taking for granted the user's ability to read medieval scripts, and some codicological knowledge, Hughes begins with the elementary material without which the user could not proceed. He describes the liturgical year, season, day, service, and the form of individual items such as responsory or lesson, and mentions the many variants in terminology that are to be found in the sources. The presentation of individual text and chant is discussed, with an emphasis on the organisation of the individual column, line, and letter. Hughes examines the hitherto unexplored means by which a hierarchy of initial and capital letters and their colours are used by the scribes and how this hierarchy can provide a means by which the modern researcher can navigate through the manuscripts. Also described in great detail are the structure and contents of Breviaries, Missals, and the corresponding books with music. This new edition updates the bibliography and the new preface by Hughes presents his recent thoughts about terminology and methods of liturgical abbreviation.</p></p><p>No book, at least in English, has struggled with the difficulties of finding texts, chants, or other material in the liturgical manuscripts themselves, until the publication of Medieval Manuscripts for Mass and Office in 1982.

She lives in South Orange, New Jersey, with her husband and two small maniacs.

Thyme embraces her role as the helpful middle sister, secretly saving slips of "time"&#x2014;good behavior chits&#x2014;so she can go home, all the while trying to avoid adjusting to New York or letting anyone at school know about Val's illness. With just the right pace of character development and a believable voice for the shy, awkward Thyme, Conklin takes her protagonist through a journey of connecting to others and learning to articulate her own needs. A constant but quiet tension runs throughout, both concerning Val's health and Thyme's emotional growth; readers continuously watch Thyme's reactions as other characters&#x2014;including a cute boy who seems to understand about secrets&#x2014;reach out to her. Sadness and hope are well balanced, and the family characters and interactions are tense but full of love. Most experienced readers will recognize several overused plot points (e.g., young girl befriends lonely, grumpy, elderly neighbor; immigrant housekeeper lends strength through her cooking) and wonder at this upper middle class white girl's lack of awareness or curiosity about her cultural and socioeconomic place in her new home.

Sklar shows how the White House sabotaged peace negoatiations and sustained the deadly contra war despite public opposition, with secret U.S. special forces and an auxiliary arm of dictators, drug smugglers and death squad godfathers, and illuminates an alternative policy rooted in law and democracy.</p><p>Washington's War on Nicaragua is a thorough investigation into the contemporary involvement of the American government's attempt to disrupt-overtly and covertly-the Nicaraguan revolution and destabilize the Sandinista government. Following a brief historical outline of United States military intervention into Nicaragua, the background to this government's current policy is set out with a description of the Carter administration's role during the period in which the opposition to the Somoza family rule was developing. Synthesized from a number of published sources and gleaned from interviews are the intricacies of intelligence operations and diplomatic efforts first to moderate Somoza's domestic policies and then to combat the leftist elements in the country that succeeded in deposing Somoza and running the country. The arguments and evidence presented, while not specifically stated, are put forth in a manner whose purpose is to indict the American foreign policy toward Nicaragua and Central America. The materials are geared to appeal to the readers' emotions. Thus, there is a wealth of information but little analysis, and the framework is not especially clear except for the obvious intent of the author. All the vignettes tend to cast either an evil light on American governmental intentions or at least a strong sense of incompetence, especially when a covert action fails and comes to public light. Overall, this is one of the better studies on the United States involvement in the undercover war with Nicaragua. It is strongly recommended to a wide audience ranging from the general reader and the public library to the specialist in an academic setting. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Among recent books on U.S. policy in Nicaragua, this one stands out for its combination of fact, historical analysis and open disgust over American arrogance. Sklar ( Trilateralism ) maintains that fear of "another Cuba" is an illusion fostered by the Reagan administration's propaganda-lobbying effort and argues that "another Vietnam" is a more likely parallel. She warns that a Central American invasion will remain a prospect even after Reagan leaves office. Both liberals and conservatives claim the unilateral, self-ordained right of the United States to define Latin American destiny by interference, the author contends, finding this attitude nowhere more blatant than in U.S. policy toward Nicaragua. Sklar advocates ending all efforts to manipulate, destabilize or overthrow the Sandinistas, and the payment of reparations, the signing of a nonaggression pact between Washington and Managua, and cancelation of all U.S. military maneuvers in the region. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Intuitive Warrior: Lessons from a Navy SEAL on Unleashing Your Hidden Potential</h2><p>From conflicts in Panama to the war in Iraq, Navy SEAL Michael Jaco has employed his powers of perception and awareness to save his life and the lives of his fellow SEALs.

For more than thirty years between 1873 and 1905, Winslow Homer turned to watercolors during his working vacations, concentrating on capturing the spirit of each place he visited with both spontaneity and intensity. Many of Homerï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122;s most beautiful paintings focus on the interaction between humans and natureï¿½&#x20ac;&#x201d;a hunter carrying a deer on his shoulders, a man fishing from a small canoe, a girl lounging and reading in the grass, a young man driving cattle, a fishermanï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122;s family anxiously watching for his return. It is Homerï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122;s understanding of this important relationship between humans and nature that makes his paintings so intriguing. Winslow Homer Watercolors reproduces the best of these paintings. Large color plates allow these reproductions to be appreciated almost as much as the originals. Accompanying the more than 100 color plates is an eloquent introduction and detailed chronology of Homerï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122;s life and artistic development. This stunning volume allows one to experience nature through the eyes of one of Americaï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122;s greatest painters. It is a vision of nature from a century ago that is still appreciated today.</p><p>Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., is senior curator emeritus, American and British Painting, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

The Bulgarian Army was mainly equipped with German weapons, or equipment captured by the Germans and then sold to Bulgaria. The negotiations as well as supplies of motor vehicles and armored vehicles are described at length. The combat service of the army's armored units is also described in detail, firmly based on archival research. Despite Bulgaria's entry into World War II as early as 1941, the only military actions during the first period of the war were related to the occupation of parts of Yugoslavia and Greece. The real combat service of the Bulgarian Army began in September 1944 against its former ally, the Germans. The delivery of armored fighting vehicles for 1st Bulgarian Army from the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front 1945 is described in detail. <br><br>Until very recently, the fate of all armored fighting vehicles in the Bulgarian Army in 1945 remained completely unknown. The classified status of the documents prevented any detailed study. However, this is now possible, and full coverage is provided. <br><br>In addition to a detailed narrative, the author also provides full information covering camouflage, markings, and unit insignia. The authoritative text is supported by over 600 photographs (the majority of them previously unpublished), color profiles showing camouflage, markings, color unit insignia and color battle maps. <br><br>This book is a result of the author's years of study in the Bulgarian Central Military Archive. Such a detailed study on this topic has not appeared before, and the author's work is unlikely to be superseded.</p><p>Kaloyan Matev lives and works in Sofia, capital city of Bulgaria. He graduated from the Technical University in Sofia, specialising in motor vehicles. His career is related to the automotive business in Bulgaria. He was a member of the editors&#39; group of the Bulgarian specialized scale modeling magazine &#39;Club Models&#39; from 1999 to 2003. He specialises in researching the Second World War period. He is the author of three books published in Bulgaria related to motor vehicles and armour during World War II. He has published a number of articles in Bulgarian magazines relating to the history of heavy weapons, motor vehicles and armoured fighting vehicles of the Bulgarian Army."In this thick volume, it would be safe to estimate the photographs occupy substantially more space than does the text.

Written with an immediate sense of place--claustrophobic and ominous--James Franco's collection traces the lives of an extended group of teenagers as they experiment with vices of all kinds, struggle with their families and one another, and succumb to self-destructive, often heartless nihilism. In "Lockheed" a young woman's summer--spent working a dull internship--is suddenly upended by a spectacular incident of violence at a house party.&nbsp; In "American History" a high school freshman attempts to impress a girl during a classroom skit with a realistic portrayal of a slave owner&#x2014;only to have his feigned bigotry avenged. In "I Could Kill Someone," a lonely teenager buys a gun with the aim of killing his high school tormentor, but begins to wonder about his bully's own inner life. <br>These linked stories, stark, vivid, and disturbing, are a compelling portrait of lives on the rough fringes of youth.</p><p>James Franco is an acclaimed&nbsp;actor, director,&nbsp;artist, and writer. His film appearances include <i>127 Hours</i>,&nbsp;<i>Milk</i>,&nbsp;<i>Pineapple Express</i>, <i>Oz the Great and Powerful</i>, <i>Spring Breakers</i>,&nbsp;and the Spider-Man trilogy.&nbsp; Franco has written and&nbsp;directed several films, and his visual art has been featured in solo shows in Los Angeles and New York.&nbsp;His writing has appeared in <i>Esquire</i>, <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>McSweeney&#x2019;s</i>, and other publications. Franco has an MFA in creative writing from Brooklyn College.When I got to high school I didn&#x2019;t have friends. My best friend moved away, and I wasn&#x2019;t popular. I didn&#x2019;t go to parties. I got drunk only once, at a wedding. I puked behind a gazebo. I <br><br>was with my cousin Jamie, who is gay. He goes to high school in Menlo Park, which is a five-minute drive. He is my only friend. He smokes menthol cigarettes. <br><br>After school I would go home. Me and Mom and Tim would watch <i>Roseanne </i>at the dinner table because Dad wasn&#x2019;t there to say no. <br><br>Then Dad would come home and we would study. A lot of times my math tests were on Thursdays, so my dad and I would study extra long on Wednesdays, and I would miss <i>Beverly Hills 90210</i>. I never taped it. <br><br>I did so well in math class that I got this internship for the summer at Lockheed Martin. They make missiles and satellites. I was the only girl out of ten students who got selected. <br><br>My dad was very excited. <br><br>He said, &#x201c;Marissa, one day you and I will work together.&#x201d; <br><br>That summer, between my freshman and sophomore years, I worked for a Swedish guy named Jan, pronounced Yan. My job was to watch old film reels of the moon. There were hundreds. I worked in a cold, windowless basement. The reels would run from one spool to another on this old machine that looked like a tank. I was supposed to record blemishes and splices in the film. Sometimes the moon was full; sometimes it would get a little more full as I watched. Sometimes the film was scratched so badly it skipped, or it broke. I was in the basement forty hours a week. I watched so many moons. <br><br>It got so boring, I stopped looking for splices. Instead, I drew pictures on computer paper that I pulled from the recycling bin. Jan was never around, so I drew a lot. I drew rainbows, and people, and cities, and guns, and people getting shot and bleeding, and people having sex. When I got tired I just drew doodles. I tried to draw portraits of people I knew. My family always looked ridiculous, but funny because the pictures resembled them, but not enough. Then I drew all these things from my childhood, like Hello Kitty and Rainbow Brite and My Little Pony. I drew my brother&#x2019;s G.I. Joes. I made the My Little Ponys kill the G.I. Joes. <br><br>I drew hundreds of pictures and they were all bad. I wasn&#x2019;t good at drawing. It was also a little sad to draw so much because I could see everything that was inside me. I had drawn everything I could think of. All that was inside me was a bunch of toys, and TV shows, and my family. My life was boring. I only had one kiss, and it was with my gay cousin, Jamie. <br><br>One day, Jan came down to the basement. He saw all my little drawings. He didn&#x2019;t say much. He picked them up and looked at them. He looked at every picture that was there. When he finished with each, he put it onto a neat pile. <br><br>He was tall and restrained, with clean, fading blond hair, combed back, with a slight wave in the front. He had a plain gold wedding band. As he looked at the pictures, I tried to <br><br>imagine what he did for fun, but I couldn&#x2019;t. He put the last picture down on the neat stack and looked at me. <br><br>&#x201c;How is Mr. Moon?&#x201d; he asked. In his accent his words came out short and clean. There was a hint of warmth, but it was contained. <br><br>&#x201c;I found a few scratches today,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said, and left. I didn&#x2019;t draw any more that day. I looked at the moon. <br><br>The next day I was back in the basement. It was almost lunchtime, and Jan came in. <br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; he said, and turned and walked out. I followed him down the hall and outside. We crossed the parking lot, me following him. The surface of the blacktop was melting where they had put tar to fill in the cracks. There were no trees in the parking lot and the sun was pushing hard. I followed the back of Jan&#x2019;s light yellow shirt and tan slacks over to his truck. It was an old, faded mustard-colored pickup that said toyota in white on the back. <br><br>When I got to the truck, he was messing around with something in the stake bed. He put the back part that said toyota down. On top of this, he laid out a big, black portfolio. <br><br>He opened it and there were drawings inside. <br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he said. He stepped back, and I looked. He said, &#x201c;These are mine.&#x201d; <br><br>They were good. They were mostly portraits. There were a bunch of portraits of a pretty woman&#x2019;s face, all the same woman. He was a lot better than I was. <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Greta, my wife,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She was not my wife then, when I made them. She became my wife.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s very beautiful,&#x201d; I said. She was. Prettier than me. <br><br>&#x201c;I did these when I was at school,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I wanted to be artist. But it was no good. It is no good to be artist. I practiced every day, eight hours a day. Then I could draw like Michelangelo. Then what? There is already Michelangelo. I realized there was nothing more to do. In science, there is always more to learn. Always more.&#x201d; <br><br>I didn&#x2019;t look at him; I looked at his pictures. I felt very lonely. I pictured him and his wife, alone at a long table, eating some bland Swedish food, not talking. The only sounds were <br><br>from the utensils hitting the plates, and the squish of their gentle chewing. <br><br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You see.&#x201d; He reached over me and shut the portfolio to punctuate the &#x201c;You see,&#x201d; but I didn&#x2019;t know what to see. Then I looked at him. He stood there and looked at <br><br>me. We were so awkward. <br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;See you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;See you,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>ï¿½ 2010 WHOSE DOG R U Productions, Inc.</p><h2>United University Professions: Pioneering in Higher Education Unionism</h2><p><i>Tells the story of the nation's largest higher education union from its earliest years to its role today as a powerful organization promoting the interests of faculty, staff, and the entire SUNY community.</i><br><br>Public education, from pre-K through higher education, and labor unions, particularly those representing public sector workers, are today under attack from those who question the very need to have such basic institutions. <i>United University Professions</i> is a history of United University Professions (UUP), which grew from humble beginnings to become the nation&#x2019;s largest higher education union, representing some 35,000 academic and professional staff within the State University of New York (SUNY) system.

It already ate up all the cats and dogs around here. I can&#x2019;t even let my dang little brother out the front door no more.&#x201d;<br><br> The hundred-year-old house sat on a narrow lot on the edge of a battered Milwaukee neighborhood that, like the house, had seen better days. It was early November, not warm, not even by Wisconsin standards. The leaves had already fallen from the skeletal trees that towered overhead.<br><br> But the sun was out, which counted for something. And the sky was a high, pale morning blue. Not a morning for static. Not at all.<br><br> Peter Ash said, &#x201c;Just how big is this dog?&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie shook his head. &#x201c;Never seen it up close, sir, and never in daylight. But it&#x2019;s awfully dang big, I can tell you that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you call animal control?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, my mama called,&#x201d; said Charlie. &#x201c;Two men came, took one look under there, got right back in their truck and drove away.&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie wore a school uniform, a light-blue permanent-press dress shirt, dark-blue polyester dress pants, and giant polished black shoes on his oversized feet. He was the kind of skinny, big-eared, twelve-year-old kid who could eat six meals a day and still be hungry.<br><br> But his eyes were older than his years. They didn&#x2019;t miss a thing.<br><br> He was watching Peter Ash now.<br><br> Peter sat on the closed lid of a wooden toolbox, his wide, knuckly hands on the work-worn knees of his carpenter&#x2019;s jeans, peering through the narrow access hatch cut into the rotted pine slats enclosing the space under the porch. He had to admit the dog sounded big. He could hear it growling back there in the darkness. Like a tank engine on idle, only louder.<br><br> He had a&nbsp;.45 under the seat of his pickup, but he didn&#x2019;t want to use it. It wasn&#x2019;t the dog&#x2019;s fault, not really. It was hungry and scared and alone, and all it had was its teeth.<br><br> On the other hand, Peter had told Charlie&#x2019;s mother, Dinah, that he would fix the rotting supports beneath her ancient porch.<br><br> She hadn&#x2019;t mentioned the dog.<br><br> Peter really couldn&#x2019;t blame her.<br><br> Her husband had killed himself.<br><br> And it was Peter&#x2019;s fault.<br><br>**<br><br> Peter was lean and rangy, muscle and bone, nothing extra. His long face was angular, the tips of his ears slightly pointed, his dark hair the unruly shag of a buzz cut grown wild. He had the thoughtful eyes of a werewolf a week before the change.<br><br> Some part of him was always in motion&#x2014;even now, sitting on that toolbox, peering under that porch, his knee bobbed in time to some interior metronome that never ceased.<br><br> He&#x2019;d fought two wars over eight years, with more deployments than he cared to remember. The tip of the spear. He&#x2019;d be thirty-one in January.<br><br> As he bent to look through the narrow access hatch under the porch, he could feel the white static fizz and pop at the base of his skull. That was his name for the fine-grained sensation he lived with now, the white static. A vague crackling unease, a dissonant noise at the edge of hearing. It wasn&#x2019;t quite uncomfortable, not yet. The static was just reminding him that it didn&#x2019;t want him to go inside.<br><br> Peter knew it would get worse before he was done.<br><br> So he might as well get to it.<br><br> The space under the porch was about three feet high. Maybe twelve feet wide and twelve deep, with a dirt floor. About the size of four freshly dug graves, laid sideways. The smell was rank, worse than a sergeant&#x2019;s feet after two months in a combat outpost. But not as bad as a two-week-old corpse.<br><br> Light trickled in through the slatted sides of the porch, but shadows shrouded the far corner, some kind of cast-off crap back there. And that growl he could just about feel through the soles of his boots.<br><br> It would be good to do this without being chewed on too much.<br><br> He went out to his truck and found a cordless trouble light, some good rope, and a length of old handrail. White oak, an inch and three-quarters thick, maybe eighteen inches long. Nice and solid in the hand. Which was a help when you were contemplating something spectacularly stupid.<br><br> Serenaded by the growls from the crawl space, he sat down on the toolbox and took out his knife while young Charlie Johnson watched.<br><br> Not that Peter wanted an audience. This certainly could get ugly.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have someplace to go, Charlie? School or something?&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie glanced at a cheap black digital watch strapped to his skinny wrist. &#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not yet I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> Peter just shook his head. He didn&#x2019;t like it, but he understood. He figured he wasn&#x2019;t that far from twelve years old himself.<br><br> He cut three short lengths from his rope and left the remainder long, ten or twelve feet. Tied one end of a short piece of rope tight to each end of the oak rail. Looped the last short rope and the remainder through his belt a single time, so he could get at it quickly.<br><br> Then he looked up at Charlie again. &#x201c;You better get out of here, kid. If this goes bad, you don&#x2019;t want to be around.&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a dang kid. Sir. I&#x2019;m the man of the family.&#x201d; He reached inside the door, brought out an aluminum baseball bat, and demonstrated his swing. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my dang porch. My little brother, too. I ain&#x2019;t going nowhere.&#x201d;<br><br> Charlie&#x2019;s dad always had the same look behind the Humvee&#x2019;s&nbsp;.50 turret gun. Eyes wide open and ready for trouble. Daring any motherfucker to pop up with an RPG or Kalashnikov or whatever. But when his wife, Dinah, sent cookies, Big Jimmy Johnson&#x2014;known inevitably to the platoon&#x2019;s jokers as Big Johnson, or just plain Big&#x2014;was always the last to eat one.<br><br> Peter missed him.<br><br> He missed them all. The dead and the living.<br><br> He said, &#x201c;Okay, Charlie. I can respect that.&#x201d; He put his eyes on the boy and held them there. &#x201c;But if that dog gets loose you get your butt in that house, you hear me? And if you hit me with that bat I&#x2019;m going to be seriously pissed.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yessir.&#x201d; Charlie nodded. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t promise anything, sir. But I&#x2019;ll do my best.&#x201d;<br><br> Peter smiled to himself. At least the kid was honest.<br><br> After that there was nothing more to do but lean back and kick out the slats on one side of the porch, letting in more daylight. The space was still small. The tank engine in the shadows got louder. But no sign of the dog. Must be lurking in that trash pile in the far corner.<br><br> Not that it mattered. He wasn&#x2019;t turning away from the challenge. He was just planning how to succeed.<br><br> The familiar taste filled his mouth, a coppery flavor, like blood. He felt the adrenaline lift and carry him forward. It was similar to the static, rising. The body&#x2019;s preparation for fight or flight. It was useful.<br><br> He peered under the porch, and the static rose higher still. The static didn&#x2019;t care about the snarling dog. It cared about the enclosure. It jangled his nerves, raced his heart, tightened his chest, and generally clamored for his attention. It wanted him to stay outside in the open air, in the daylight.<br><br> Breathing deeply, Peter took the piece of oak and banged it on the wood frame of the porch. It rang like a primitive musical instrument.<br><br> Despite everything, he was smiling.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, dog,&#x201d; he called into the darkness. &#x201c;Watch your ass, I&#x2019;m coming in!&#x201d;<br><br> And in he went, headfirst on his elbows and knees, the stick in one hand and the trouble light in the other.<br><br> What, you want to live forever?</p><h2>Jumpin Jack Flash: David Litvinoff and the Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Underworld</h2><p><b>A fascinating quest for one of London's legendary characters.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Litvinoff (1928-75) was 'one of the great mythic characters of '60s London' -- outrageous, possessed of a lightning wit and intellect, dangerous to know, always lurking in the shadows as the spotlight shone on his famous friends. Flitting between the worlds of music, art and crime, he exerted a hidden influence that helped create the Kray twins' legend and Lucian Freud's reputation as a man never to be crossed; connected the Rolling Stones with London's dark side; redirected Eric Clapton's musical career; and shaped the plot of the classic film&nbsp;<i>Performance</i>&nbsp;by revealing his knowledge of the city's underworld, a decision that put his life in danger.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Litvinoff's determination to live without trace means that his life has always eluded biographers, until now. This extraordinary feat of research entailed 100 interviews over five years: the result is by turns wickedly funny, appalling, revelatory and moving, and epic in its scope as it traces a rogue's progress at the interface of bohemia and criminality from the early Fifties to the Seventies. It is also an account of Keiron Pim's determined pursuit of Litvinoff's ghost, which took him from London to Wales and Australia in a quest to reveal one of British pop culture's last great untold stories.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His interviewees span all the worlds in which Litvinoff moved. They include musicians such as Eric Clapton and Marianne Faithfull; actors including&nbsp;<i>Performance</i>&nbsp;stars James Fox and Johnny Shannon; upper class friends of Litvinoff's such as society antiques dealer Christopher Gibbs and the eccentric Lord Harlech; criminals such as 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and associates of the Kray twins; artists Martin Sharp and Nigel Waymouth; writers such as Iain Sinclair, Alan Moore and David's half-brother Emanuel Litvinoff; and Bob Geldof, who now owns the house in which Litvinoff committed suicide.</p><p>KEIRON PIM is aged 37, married with three young daughters and lives in Norwich, where he was for a decade the literary editor of the&nbsp;<i>Eastern Daily Press</i>newspaper before leaving to concentrate on writing books. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Bumper Book of Dinosaurs (</i>Square Peg) and he edited and introduced&nbsp;<i>Into the Light: the Medieval Hebrew Poetry of Meir of Norwich</i>, the first translated edition of England's only major medieval Hebrew poet.&#34;The rock&#39;n&#39;roll legend of David Litvinoff is given its definitive account. A considerable work of detection and human sympathy unpicking old myths and making them new.&#34; -- Iain Sinclair &#34;This surely has the most startling beginning of any biography to be published this year... Vivid, engrossing... Pim gives an all too graphic picture of the seedy 1950s... He is compassionate and humane at every moment. His prose is always careful and stylish.&#34; -- Richard Davenport-Hines Guardian &#34;Blending pop culture, social history and interviews with raddled survivors, Pim reconstructs every scene in Litvinoff&#39;s twisted history...

Jumpin&#39; Jack Flash provides the missing piece of Swinging London&#39;s social jigsaw.&#34; -- Dominic Green Literary Review &#34;Fascinating biography... Pim has a thorough knowledge of his subject and his milieu and is painstaking in his research... Against the odds, Keiron Pim has written a very good book about a very bad man.&#34; -- David Collard Times Literary Supplement &#34;A captivating and prodigiously well-researched account of that legendary 1960s London sub-world where criminality and bohemianism met head-on.&#34; -- D. J. Taylor &#34;Pim&#39;s account of this extraordinary character is a magisterial work of scholarship.&#34; -- Colin MacCabe New Statesman &#34;Revelatory... The impressive list of character references in this extraordinary book gives some indication of just how singular a creature [David Litvinoff] was, and the mind-boggling diversity of the worlds in which he moved.&#34; -- Mick Brown Daily Telegraph &#34;Keiron Pim has grafted long and hard to separate the facts from the heady fictions... Pim does a great job of bringing the era and some of its most colourful characters to life.&#34; -- Chris Maume Independent &#34;Litvinoff was a shape-shifter whose story...offers a window into a secret side of the 60s.&#34; -- Jon Savage Guardian &#34;Keiron Pim&#39;s Jumping Jack Flash is an outstanding study of a remarkable, but until now wholly elusive figure. Meticulously researched and elegantly written, Pim&#39;s work is the first to bring us the story of David Litvinoff, that real-life Zelig of post-war British bohemia. And via the magnesium flare of his subject&#39;s story, Pim illumines the multifaceted world through which he moved: East End gangsters, Chelsea aristos, Soho artists and Notting Hill hippies. Litvinoff, for so long the missing piece of so many cultural jigsaws, finally gets a story of his own and it&#39;s even more bizarre than one might have hoped. This will be an indispensable read for anyone who appreciates that mad, alluring, myth-filled world.&#34; -- Jonathon Green, author of &#39;Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground&#39; &#34;Keiron Pim&#39;s Jumping Jack Flash is a kaleidoscopic ride through the acid-fields of Fities and Sixties London in search of David Litvinoff, a brilliant, desolate, unforgettable yet hard-to-focus gay Jewish grifter. Ironic stereotype and rebel at once, Litvinoff chars the car-crash societies he moves through. Mick Jagger, Lucian Freud and the Kray twins flash past in the throng, all sustained by drugs, sex, art, film and a great deal of rock&#39;n&#39;roll. Litvinoff is dazzling. Pim&#39;s pilgrimage is appropriately and meticulously dazzled.&#34; -- George Szirtes &#34;Pim is a skilful and erudite writer.&#34; -- Clive Davis The Times &#34;Pim has set out to write the definitive biography of a man who was the very definition of an unreliable narrator... Fascinating.&#34; -- Andrew Anthony Observer &#34;A tour-de-force of biography, a beautifully written account of a compelling but often repulsive man. It&#39;s hard to imagine anyone getting closer to the truth than Keiron.&#34; Eastern Daily Press</p><h2>Globalization: A Short History</h2><p><p>"Globalization" has become a popular buzzword for explaining today's world. The expression achieved terminological stardom in the 1990s and was soon embraced by the general public and integrated into numerous languages.</p><p> But is this much-discussed phenomenon really an invention of modern times? In this work, Jï¿½rgen Osterhammel and Niels Petersson make the case that globalization is not so new, after all. Arguing that the world did not turn "global" overnight, the book traces the emergence of globalization over the past seven or eight centuries. In fact, the authors write, the phenomenon can be traced back to early modern large-scale trading, for example, the silk trade between China and the Mediterranean region, the shipping routes between the Arabian Peninsula and India, and the more frequently traveled caravan routes of the Near East and North Africa--all conduits for people, goods, coins, artwork, and ideas.</p><p> Osterhammel and Petersson argue that the period from 1750 to 1880--an era characterized by the development of free trade and the long-distance impact of the industrial revolution--represented an important phase in the globalization phenomenon. Moreover, they demonstrate how globalization in the mid-twentieth century opened up the prospect of global destruction though nuclear war and ecological catastrophe. In the end, the authors write, today's globalization is part of a long-running transformation and has not ushered in a "global age" radically different from anything that came before.</p><p> This book will appeal to historians, economists, and anyone in the social sciences who is interested in the historical emergence of globalization.</p></p><p><p>"Two German historians have very successfully put the phenomenon of globalization into historical perspective--and they are highly qualified to do so.

Treated as a lover, a follower, a guardian, each new encounter&#x2014;with an enigmatic stranger, a group of careless backpackers, a woman on the verge&#x2014;leads him closer to confronting his own identity. Traversing the quiet of wilderness and the frenzy of border crossings, every new direction is tinged with surmounting mourning, as he is propelled toward a tragic conclusion.<br><br> <i>In a Strange Room</i> is a brilliant, stylish novel of anger and compassion, longing and thwarted desire, and a hauntingly beautiful evocation of life on the road.

He lives in Cape Town.Starred Review. There&#39;s a lot of travel in Booker Prize finalist Galgut&#39;s (The Good Doctor) new novel, but he&#39;s more interested in depicting the randomness, heightened sensitivity, dread, and possibility that come from unfamiliar places than in seeing the sights. A South African man travels in Greece, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, and India, forming the complicated, tenuous relationships that provide the book&#39;s three sections titles (Follower; Lover; Guardian). This character, who bears the author&#39;s name and seems to share his history, is both &#34;he&#34; and &#34;I.&#34; Though these shifts can occur in the space of a sentence, they&#39;re surprisingly easy to accept, and attentive readers will get a subtle, frank depiction of some of the problems of writing; &#34;he&#34; seems to be Galgut, but often experiences himself as divided, uncertain, and blurry as a fictional character evading his creator, &#34;I&#34; often steps in to remind us of the limits of memory and the artificiality of genre distinctions.

The editors are to be congratulated for successfully eliminating some of the problems identified with the earlier work. For example, the limited number of synonyms provided for each word in the 1988 edition has been greatly increased (e.g., <i>glee</i> now has 17 synonyms instead of the one listed in the 1988 edition), and the use of cross-references to words in a category index provides antonyms and lists of synonym groups related to a particular sense of the headword. Although helpful, some users may be initially confused by this latter vehicle. For example, users looking up the word <i>uproot</i> are referred to the words <i>make</i> and <i>help</i> in the index (where reasonable synonyms are found under the antonyms <i>unmake</i> and <i>harm</i>). Easier to use are indications that synonyms for specific senses of a headword can be found as headwords elsewhere in the thesaurus (e.g., for the headword <i>squirt</i>, <i>jet</i> is indicated by a superscript as a synonym also listed as a headword).<p>Deleted from this edition are illustrative quotes (unfavorably viewed by <i>RBB</i> in its review of the 1988 edition), but added are helpful slang and regional synonyms and more idioms. Also added are clearer differentiations among senses of a word. The definitions provided for each headword are less telegraphic in writing style than those in the 1988 edition, but may, in some cases, be misleading. The editors indicate that every definition was checked by the editors of the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> (3d ed.). However, some definitions do not seem to reflect this process. For example, <i>distraught</i> is still defined as "afflicted with or exhibiting irrationality and mental unsoundness," even though the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> defines the most common sense of the word as "deeply agitated, as from emotional conflict" .</p><p><i>Roget's II</i> does not provide the comprehensive coverage of <i>Roget's International Thesaurus</i> (HarperCollins, 1992) or <i>Roget's 21st Century Thesaurus</i> (Dell, 1992). However, its alphabetical sequence of headwords supplemented by a category index and plentiful cross-references supplies an array of colorful and vivid synonyms that will be helpful for writers who do not have the time to engage in the long process of using a classified or category-indexed thesaurus like those mentioned above.

But for the 87th Precinct detectives Carella and Hawes, the murder of an old woman makes the wee hours anything but peaceful--especially when they learn she was one of the greatest concert pianists of the century long vanished. Meanwhile 88th Precinct cop Fat Ollie Weeks has his own early morning nightmare: he&#39;s on the trail of three prep school boys and a crack dealer who spent the evening carving up a hooker.</p><p>Once she had filled the concert halls of Europe with beautiful music. Once her name had been in headlines, her performances heralded in newspapers around the world. Now she lay dead on the cold floor of a cold apartment on the coldest night of the year: a little old woman with a shattered bottle of cheap liquor by her body and two fatal gunshot wounds to her chest. Svetlana Dyalovich, found dead at midnight, was one more homicide in one more endless night in the city. For detectives Carella and Hawes, no murder is ever routine, and while this one looks at first like a robbery, the evidence doesn&#39;t add up. And when Carella and Hawes interview Svetlana&#39;s hard-edged, lounge-singing granddaughter - a woman accompanied by two armed bodyguards - they start looking for a missing envelope full of money and for a killer who had more than robbery on his mind.Ed McBain was one of the pen names of successful and prolific crime fiction author Evan Hunter (1926&#x2013;2005).

Kelly&#x2019;s hip hopera <i>Trapped in the Closet</i>. Most down-low stories are morality tales in which black men are either predators who risk infecting their unsuspecting female partners with HIV or victims of a pathological black culture that repudiates openly gay identities. In both cases, down-low narratives depict black men as sexually dangerous, duplicitous, promiscuous, and contaminated.</p><p>In <i>Nobody Is Supposed to Know</i>, C. Riley Snorton traces the emergence and circulation of the down low in contemporary media and popular culture to show how these portrayals reinforce troubling perceptions of black sexuality. Reworking Eve Sedgwick&#x2019;s notion of the &#x201c;glass closet,&#x201d; Snorton advances a new theory of such representations in which black sexuality is marked by hypervisibility and confinement, spectacle and speculation. Through close readings of news, music, movies, television, and gossip blogs, <i>Nobody Is Supposed to Know </i>explores the contemporary genealogy, meaning, and functions of the down low.</p><p>Snorton examines how the down low links blackness and queerness in the popular imagination and how the down low is just one example of how media and popular culture surveil and police black sexuality. Looking at figures such as Ma Rainey, Bishop Eddie L. Long, J. L. King, and Will Smith, he ultimately contends that down-low narratives reveal the limits of current understandings of black sexuality.<br></p></p><p><p>C.

Drawing on interviews with victims, lawyers, prosecutors, and even convicted molesters, Patrick Boyle paints a distressing but accurate picture of betrayal in a place we all thought was safe.<b>About the Author<br>Patrick Boyle</b> is a veteran journalist whose reports on child abuse, mental illness, and drug addiction have won awards from the Society of Professional Journalists, the National Headliner Awards, the Missouri School of Journalism, and others. He has been a reporter for many newspapers, including the <i>Washington Times</i>, and a freelance reporter for the <i>New York Times</i>, ABC News, <i>Woman's Day</i>, <i>Spy</i>, and the <i>American Journalism Review</i>.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Boyle puts a human face on sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts by placing one offender's story at the center of his report. Now imprisoned for his second Scout-abuse conviction, Carl Bittenbender's a nice guy, not gay (boy-molesters usually aren't, Boyle says), "good" with kids; he fits the profile for scoutmaster--and, unfortunately, also for the typical boy-molester. Skilled at conning others and himself (he knows molestation is wrong), he's pitiable, even forgiveable. But not trustworthy. Boyle demonstrates that the Boy Scouts' national organization knew about Bittenbender and his ilk since it has kept files on sex offenders among scouting volunteers for decades. But it largely ignored them, never using them systematically to help local scouting officers screen prospective volunteers. Until Bittenbender's and other cases exploded in the press during the 1980s, that is, since when it has done nearly everything--short of admitting to molestation troubles from scouting's beginnings--to correct its neglect. An absorbing, admirably evenhanded treatment of one of those things nobody wants to talk about--which, of course, is a large part of the problem. <i>Ray Olson</i>Although the subject matter of Scouts Honor will put some readers off, it deserves to be read. By focusing on the molesters-rather than their victims-the book offers an eye-opening look at exactly how child molesters operate and how society has let them get away with it. According to Boyle, who carefully researched the history of the Boy Scouts and conducted interviews with eight former scout leaders who molested boys, the scouting institution has served as a magnet for pedophiles since it inception. Although the Boy Scouts has recently taken effective steps to combat this problem, Boyle asserts that the best protection remains "a family life that is supportive and emotionally sound so that a child does not seek attention and affection elsewhere."

The Progressive Era served as a way station between agrarian and urban America: into it came men and women, institutions, and values born on the farms and in the towns; out of it emerged the first practical experiments in social reorganization for an industrial era. Although this exciting, noisy, and hopeful period contained much lost motion, beneath the tumult it contributed lasting changes in American life. In particular, demands came largely from a wide range of middle-income Americans whose arrival as organized, articulate, and demanding citizens reordered the social structure. Privileges of leadership were redistributed to accommodate these challengers. In the process, as Mr. Wiebe shows, businessmen took the lead in demanding reforms&#x2015;but divided into bitterly hostile factions and shied away from movements to extend democracy and public welfare.

Sayers&#39; papers and photographs, many of which have never been seen, and her own memories of her subject, Barbara Reynolds has written the most readable and the most definitive biogrpahy to date of this fascinating woman.</p><p>An Italian scholar and translator, Barbara Reynolds completed the translation of Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy which Dorothy L. Sayers left unfinished when she died. Dr Reynolds has told the story of this collaboration in The Passionate Intellect: Dorothy L. Sayers&#39; Encounter with Dante. She has also translated Dante&#39;s La Vita Nuova and Ariosto&#39;s Orlando Furioso, and was the general editor of The Cambridge Italian Dictionary. More recently, Dr Reynolds founded the journal Seven, to which she has contributed articles on Dorothy L. Sayers. She is the President of the Dorothy L. Sayers Society, and has frequently lectured at the society&#39;s conferences. She is currently working on an edition of the Sayers letters, of which the first three volumes have now appeared.Another ``interim report'' on the life (1893-1957) of the creator of Lord Peter Wimsey and reluctant Christian apologist, by a longtime friend, completer of Sayers's translation of Dante and author of The Passionate Intellect: Dorothy L. Sayers' Encounter with Dante (1989- -not reviewed). The problem all Sayers's biographers face is to reconcile her early career as a pioneer and leading theorist of the formal detective story with the religious plays, essays, and lectures to which she committed her last 15 years. In the absence of a collected edition of Sayers's letters, Reynolds still tries to make Sayers speak for herself whenever possible by quoting letters, conversations, and passages from her voluminous writings. The result is a view of the writer that Sayers herself would likely have approved of: as a generous, fiercely intelligent woman whose cardinal passion, her intellectual ardor, led her from Oxford to the hand-to-mouth London bohemianism that spawned the inimitably foppish Wimsey and then, quite logically, to a defense of the writer's imagination (The Mind of the Maker) that set forth Sayers's understanding of the Trinity. Despite some stiffness in the early chapters, and a disinclination to criticize her subject even mildly, Reynolds captures the ardent nature that sustained Sayers through her unrequited love affairs, her pregnancy without marriage, her lifelong support of the son she never publicly acknowledged, and the writing she felt certain from the beginning was her vocation. It isn't until the popular Wimsey books are behind, though, that Reynolds's matching passion comes out--she calls The Mind of the Maker and The Man Born to Be King Sayers's ``two greatest works''--and the biography comes into its own, even though only a few years of Sayers's life remain before Reynolds encounters the preemptive shadow of her own earlier book. Best, then, on the later years--the years of her own friendship with Sayers--that Reynolds has already described so sympathetically. Fans of Lord Peter may feel let down.

He has written stories for children and for adults, as well as the four crime novels set in the Belleville quarter of Paris, of which The Scapegoat is the second.Benjamin Malaussne's official job title is Quality Controller, but since nobody could possibly control the quality of all the goods in his Parisian department store, his real vocation is to serve as a scapegoat who can absorb outraged customers' abuse in a manner so pathetically affecting that the customers withdraw their complaints. It looks as if Ben's met his match, though, in the latest round of outrages at the store: a series of bombings that claim the lives of a garage mechanic, a pair of smooching senior citizens, a rabid pro-life lecturer, a sanitary-equipment representative. Not only is Ben unable to mollify the shoppers who survived the blasts; he's become the number-one police suspect. After all, he was on the scene of every explosion (except for one witnessed by his half-sister Thrse on his day off); his half-brother Jeremy sets fire to his school with a similar explosive; even his dog seems mysteriously implicated. In a more straightforward telling, Ben's new lover, the ravishing shoplifter he insists on calling Aunt Julia, would help him unravel the mystery and clear himself. But that's not exactly what Pennac (Better Than Life, 1994) has in mind. The first of Ben's four adventures to be published in the US is very French and more than a little precious, with clownish Ben, like Jacques Tati's M. Hulot, a charmingly jittery guide to the mercantile postmodern. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now the historian and explorer Iain McCalman takes us on a new adventure into the reef to reveal how our shifting perceptions of the natural world have shaped this extraordinary seascape. Showcasing the lives of twenty individuals spanning more than two centuries, <i>The Reef</i> highlights our profound desire to conquer, understand, embrace, and ultimately save the world's most complex ocean ecosystem.</p><p>Opening with the story of Captain James Cook, who sailed unknowingly into the southwest entrance of this vast network of coral outcroppings, McCalman shows how Cook spent months navigating this treacherous underwater labyrinth, struggling to keep his crew alive and his ship afloat, sparring with deceptive shoals and wary native islanders. Through a series of dramatic tales from intrepid explorers, unwitting castaways, inquisitive naturalists, enchanted artists, and impassioned environmentalists who have collectively shaped our ideas about the Great Barrier Reef, McCalman demonstrates how this grand natural wonder of the world was built as much by human imagination as by the industrious, beautiful creatures of the sea. </p><p>A romantic, historically significant book and a deeply personal journey into the heart of a marine environment in peril, <i>The Reef</i> powerfully captures the delicate relationship between humanity and the natural world.</p></p><p><b>Iain McCalman</b> is a fellow of the Royal Historical Society, a historian, a social scientist, and an explorer.

It was a channel that later navigators would call the Great Barrier Reef inner passage. Cook didn&#x2019;t realize that then, and he never would.</p> <p>The point, obvious enough in his journals, needs stressing because so many historians inadvertently treat this phase of Cook&#x2019;s first voyage of exploration to the Southern Hemisphere as if the Great Barrier Reef we know today already existed somewhere in the back of his mind. As if he unconsciously knew he was about to enter into combat with a constellation of deep-water &#x201c;barrier reefs&#x201d; that ran more or less parallel with the Australian coast for some 1,400 miles, creating between them and the mainland a shallow lagoon of uneven depths interspersed with three hundred reef-fringed coral cays and striated with sand, rock, and coral shoals. In reality he sailed unknowingly within the reef lagoon for around 500 miles before he became aware of something resembling a coral &#x201c;labyrinth.&#x201d; Like explorers before him, he&#x2019;d had no intimation at all of the possible existence of this freakish phenomenon.</p> <p>For us to have any glimmer of understanding of the experiences and reactions of Cook and his crew, we, too, must rid our minds temporarily of the existence of this vast geophysical phenomenon&#x2014;a region of land and sea that in 1770 had never been imagined in its totality by any human being, and that would remain substantially unimagined even after the <i>Endeavour</i> had sailed through it.</p> <p>Cook had at this point partially completed his mission. He had fulfilled the orders of the Royal Society to make accurate observations of the transit of Venus from Otaheite (Tahiti), and was now faced with two larger and more covert tasks: to best the war-vanquished French by upstaging their scientific and imperial ambitions in the Pacific; and to discover, chart, and claim for the King of England&#x2014;with the agreement of any native peoples&#x2014;the elusive great southern land that geographers had so long hypothesized. Having made landfalls on the isles of present-day New Zealand between September 1769 and March 1770, the <i>Endeavour</i> had on April 19 sighted land along the coast of what Cook called New South Wales. On April 28 he finally managed to land on this tricky coastline, at what would become known as Botany Bay, a paradise of plants only slightly marred for him by the elusiveness and hostility of the native inhabitants.</p> <p>Since leaving Botany Bay on May 6, Cook had sighted lines of breakers suggestive of submarine shoals on several occasions, but it was only on the morning of May 20 that he was confronted with a long &#x201c;shoal&#x201d; projecting eastward from a finger of land he called Sandy Cape, which forced him to edge northeast for several miles before finding clear water. He named the shoal Breaksea Spit, because after weathering it the ship suddenly entered &#x201c;smooth water,&#x201d; a consequence of the sheltering effect of the Swain reefs that were far out of sight. Neither was there anything to suggest that the present shoal might be a coral reef rather than an extension of the rocky shoreline, though we now know it to be an extinct coral reef covered in sand.1</p> <p>What Cook actually understood of the origins and character of coral reefs at this point remains uncertain. He&#x2019;d read the travel account of Samuel Purchas in <i>Purchas His Pilgrimage</i> (1613), which described serrated deep-sea coral &#x201c;ledges,&#x201d; and he&#x2019;d recently sighted a variety of reef forms in the South Sea Islands, but it was only much later, on his second voyage, that he explicitly echoed the opinion of his onboard naturalists, the Forsters, that coral &#x201c;rockes&#x201d; were formed in the sea by &#x201c;animals.&#x201d; Before this, Cook, like many science-minded men of his time, was probably uncertain whether these protean rocklike objects were plants, animals, or minerals, or a hybrid of all three.2</p> <p>Corals had long been a taxonomist&#x2019;s nightmare, a little-studied phenomenon that early theorists assumed to be some strange sort of plant. In 1724 the Frenchman Jean-Andrï¿½ Peyssonnel overturned the work of a colleague in Montpellier with a letter to the Acadï¿½mie des Sciences, arguing for the first time that the so-called coral flower was in reality not a plant, but &#x201c;<i>un insect&#x201d;</i> that could create bone. His idea was ridiculed until it was taken up some thirty years later by the Englishman John Ellis, who in 1752 told the Royal Society in London that these creatures were &#x201c;ramified [branchlike] animals,&#x201d; after which his classification became increasingly accepted.</p> <p>For the deeply practical Yorkshire navigator James Cook, it was more important to know that corals produced vast rocklike edifices that could grow up from unfathomable depths, lurk just under the ocean surface, and sink any ship. At that time it was navigators, more than scientists, who wanted to know what corals were up to.3</p> <p>The Swain reefs responsible for the sudden smoothness of the sea were a collection of massive deepwater coral aggregations some 125 miles to the east that marked the southeastern entrance of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. In effect, the <i>Endeavour</i> had wafted into a vast natural coral basin resembling a woven Aboriginal fish trap; the latter was designed to snare its victims by enticing them into a wide entrance that narrowed suddenly to entangle them, much as the Reef was about to do by veering sharply northwest toward the mainland. As Cook&#x2019;s great editor J. C. Beaglehole observed, anyone telling the captain&#x2019;s story should at this point sound a roll of &#x201c;premonitory drums.&#x201d;4</p> <p>Cook also failed to sight what might have proved the giveaway presence of the coral cays of the Capricornia group, which were lying over the horizon to the east, some forty-three miles off the mainland. Instead, as they coasted along in a comfortable twelve to twenty fathoms of water with the coast in clear view, they skirted clusters of tall, picturesque islands that Cook named the Northumberland and the Whitsunday groups: these were former mainland volcanic mountain chains that had been transformed into islands by raised water levels and coastal subsidence.</p> <p>Even the recurring &#x201c;shoals&#x201d; surrounding these islands&#x2014;actually fringing coral reefs&#x2014;caused Cook no real alarm. Shallows, shoals, and banks held little fear for the veteran sailor who had steered dozens of coal transports like the <i>Endeavour</i> through England&#x2019;s treacherous northern coastal waters, and who had navigated flotillas of warships through the rock-filled Saint Lawrence River during the Seven Years&#x2019; War. Though irritating and, as they increased in incidence, time-consuming, shoals like these could be detected and dodged, provided the leadsman sounded the depths continually and the ship&#x2019;s pinnace was sent ahead to locate deeper channels.5</p> <p>Cook and his young companion, botanist Joseph Banks, did notice that the ship appeared to be entering a distinct new region. The sun was hotter, the air more humid, the sea warmer, the landscape rockier, and the flora more reminiscent of the West Indies. For the first time since leaving Tahiti, they observed palm nut trees and &#x201c;the true mangrove.&#x201d; These familiar plants convinced Banks that they were departing &#x201c;the Southern Temperate Zone&#x201d; and should expect to see more tropical flora. From now on, too, he and Cook would use the tropical West Indies as their template of comparison for the environments encountered. As in the Caribbean, hammer oysters and small pearl oysters were abundant, and both men speculated on the possibility of a future pearling industry for the British Empire. A brief landfall on May 29 further confirmed the similarities with Jamaica, though the lack of water and the presence of barbed grass, clouds of mosquitoes, slimy mangrove mud, and huge tides gave a bleak impression, generating the place name of Thirsty Sound.6</p> <p>The shoal dodging continued as they sailed a slow zigzag course between each new crop of continental islands and the shore. On June 9 they anchored near a small inlet, slightly east of a rocky eminence that Cook named Cape Grafton. It repeated the pattern of high &#x201c;stony&#x201d; and &#x201c;barren&#x201d; landscapes recently passed at Cape Upstart, Magnetical Island (now Magnetic), Dunk Island, and Cape Sandwich. Here, at the site of today&#x2019;s Yarrabah community, Cook and Banks scrambled up another stony peak to gaze down on yet another mangrove swamp worryingly devoid of fresh water. Spires of &#x201c;smooks&#x201d; (smoke trails) indicated the nearby presence of Indigenous people, but none were sighted. That the explorers were being watched, however, is suggested by a faint red painting of a three-masted square-rigger scored on the underside of a barely accessible rock overhang that looks out over present-day Mission Bay.7 When the <i>Endeavour</i> embarked from this bay at midnight on June 10, 1770, under a bright moon and in a slight breeze, Cook had no idea that a chain of coral reefs and cays belonging to what we now know as the outer Barrier lay pincered in toward the northeast, around fifteen miles from the ship. True, he and Banks did note the presence of a cay on a coral reef near their previous anchorage. Cook named it Green Island after the ship&#x2019;s astronomer, Charles Green. Banks suspected that it was &#x201c;laying upon a large Coral shoal, much resembling the low Islands to the eastward of us but the first of the kind we had met with in this part of the South Sea.&#x201d;8</p> <p>Even so, this isolated coral novelty failed to engender alarm or to change what had become their habitual pattern of sailing off the coast. Night visibility under a glowing moon was good, and a seaman was, as usual, standing at the bows swinging the lead to measure the depth. Cook assumed there was ample time to change course should shoals be indicated. But the retrospective entry in Cook&#x2019;s journal, dated Sunday June 10, serves as our drumroll and presages the end of their innocence, &#x201c;because,&#x201d; he wrote grimly, &#x201c;here begun all our troubles.&#x201d;9</p> <p>John Hawkesworth, the clever hack writer who produced the popular Admiralty edition of Cook&#x2019;s papers through which details of this voyage would reach the public for the next eighty years, and who would often insert his own imaginings of Cook&#x2019;s inner state of mind, has the navigator reflect to himself at this moment:</p> <p>Hitherto we had safely navigated this dangerous coast, where the sea in all parts conceals shoals that suddenly project from the shore, and rocks that rise abruptly like a pyramid from the bottom, for an extent of two and twenty degrees of latitude, more than one thousand three hundred miles; and therefore hitherto none of the names which distinguish the several parts of the country that we saw, are memorials of distress; but here we became acquainted with misfortune, we therefore called the point which we had just seen farthest to the northward, Cape Tribulation.10</p> <p>A mild scare during dinner when they crossed the tail end of a shoal was quickly succeeded by deep water, so Cook and Banks retired for the night, only to be rudely awakened around 11:00 p.m. when the water shelved suddenly from twenty fathoms to nothing and the ship struck heavily on a reef. Being twelve miles from the shore and still surrounded by deep water, Cook instantly realized that they must have hit coral.11</p> <p>Thanks to Hawkesworth&#x2019;s dramatic account, the crew&#x2019;s subsequent thirteen-hour ordeal, as they fought for the survival of the ship, has become an explorer&#x2019;s classic. We envisage the men, with horror frozen on every face and oaths stifled in their throats, staggering to retain balance as the ship tilts and beats against the rocks with a grating that can be felt through every plank. We watch helplessly while the sheathing and false keel float away in the moonlight; we hear the repeated splashes of more than fifty tons of cannon, ballast, lead, and coal being tossed overboard in a futile effort to float the impaled hull off the coral. Stark disappointment greets the risen tide&#x2019;s failure to reach the ship&#x2019;s bottom, let alone float it free. There remains only the faint hope that the night tide will be fuller.</p> <p>Hours later there is the sound of the returning tide rushing through the leak, combined with the frantic heaving of successive hands, Banks included, working the three unbroken pumps against the rising water. We feel their exhaustion as they slump on the tilted deck, oblivious of pump water gushing over their bodies. There is a surge of hope on every face as they make an unexpected gain on the leak. Then a last desperate heaving on the capstan and windlass, pulling against the taut anchor chains that radiate from the center and stern, in an effort to jump the ship off the coral. Finally, at 10:20 a.m., the <i>Endeavour</i> is heaved into deep water; soon after the young midshipman Jonathan Monkhouse&#x2019;s brilliant fothering (leak-stopping) expedient temporarily plugs the leak. He fills canvas with loose clumps of oakum, wool, and sheep&#x2019;s dung, &#x201c;or other filth.&#x201d; Cook explains that this canvas must be &#x201c;hauld from one part of her bottom to a nother until the place is found where it takes effect; while the Sail is under the Ship the Ockham [oakum] &amp;c is washed off and part of it carried along with the water into the leak and in part stops up the hole.&#x201d;12</p> <p>According to Hawkesworth, Cook&#x2014;tough and phlegmatic seaman though he was&#x2014;&#x201c;anticipated the floating of the ship not as an earnest of deliverance, but as an event that would probably precipitate our destruction.&#x201d; Cook assumed, too, that anarchy would ensue as the men sloughed off their naval discipline and fought like beasts for one of the scarce places on the boats, never realizing in their panic that a worse fate awaited them should they actually reach land:</p> <p>&#x2026; we knew that if any should be left on board to perish in the waves, they would probably suffer less upon the whole than those who should get on shore, without any lasting or effectual defense against the natives, in a country, where even nets and fire-arms would scarcely furnish them with food; and where, if they should find the means of subsistence, they must be condemned to languish out the remainder of life in a desolate wilderness, without the possession, or even hope, of any domestic comfort, and cut off from all commerce with mankind, except the naked savages who prowled the desert, and who perhaps were some of the most rude and uncivilized upon the earth.13</p> <p>Still, with the leak reduced and hope resurgent, the ship limped for the shore, butted by contrary winds and dodging awkward shallows while waiting for the master in the pinnace to find a suitable channel and a landing place to repair the hull. By Thursday, June 14, he&#x2019;d discovered a narrow passage leading to a spot on the mangrove banks of what Cook would later call the Endeavour River, the site of modern-day Cooktown.

Moreover, they lend themselves to repeat reading..." &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> <br><br>"Suiting the armchair as well as they did as long as a century ago, these articles will be popular indeed." &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> <br><br><i>Worlds to Explore</i> evokes that bygone era in which the pages of <i>National Geographic</i> were as close as most people could get to high adventure and faraway lands. The 54 tales reproduced here immerse today's readers in wonder and thrill of exploration before the age of mass tourism. Along with notable explorers such as Edmund Hillary, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and Teddy Roosevelt, other less famous travelers take us to places few Americans had ventured before. We follow as "An Unbeliever Joins the Hadj," trek "Across Tibet from India to China," and take "A Round Trip to Davy Jones's Locker." <br><br>Introduced by brief essays that provide context and perspective, these engaging selections speak for themselves&#x2014;and trace the National Geographic Society's growth as it explored the unknown and brought it home to readers eager for knowledge of "the world and all that is in it."</p><p>Mark Jenkins, chief historian of the National Geographic Society's archives, has in all likelihood read every single article ever published in the magazine. Among other accomplishments, he is the co-author of <i>High Adventure,</i> an illustrated history of the Society.Evoking adventure made possible by the railroad, steamship, and automobile, and before adventure was accelerated beyond recognition by the jet airliner, these 50 <i>National Geographic</i> articles hail from the 1890s to the 1950s. Simon Winchester's introduction rues the haste travel has acquired, while the commentary of editor Jenkins (<i> Off the Map: Bicycling across Siberia</i>, 1992) introduces the author and the genesis of his or her odyssey. Theodore Roosevelt's postpresidency safari kicks off the geographical organization--Africa, South America, and so forth--and also typifies Jenkins' editorial preferences for the lost worlds of imperialism, still-unexplored regions of earth and sea, and peoples untouched by modernity. Some of Jenkins' selections may be oft-anthologized classics by Roy Chapman Andrews, Richard Byrd, and Edmund Hillary, but most are not frequently reprinted. Collectively, Jenkins' grouping captures imagination-firing details in non-Western settings, such as capture by Mongolian bandits. Suiting the armchair as well as they did as long as a century ago, these articles will be popular indeed. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Her father and older brother chose to join the Vietminh to drive the French from Vietnam. The Vietminh were supported by the Communist backed National Liberation Front (NLF) who were there to win the hearts and minds of the Vietminh fighters. Yung Krall&#39;s father was one of those who chose to join with Communist cause, over the years rising in the organization to become Hanoi&#39;s Ambassador to Russia. Yung&#39;s mother subscribed to free and democratic ideals, eventually moving the rest of her family to live near Saigon, where Yung Krall would meet her future husband a US Navy pilot. Years later, when the fall of Saigon was imminent, Lt. Commander John Krall, on his own accord, helped free Yung&#39;s family only days before the invasion and fall of Saigon. Living in the US and now a naturalized citizen, Yung Krall was recruited by the CIA to serve as an espionage agent gaining valuable information on communist subversives here in the United States. She would ultimately discover that a senior US official, with a top secret clearance was selling classified information to the communists. Her work with the CIA and FBI resulted in the only espionage prosecution associated with the Vietnam war. US Information Agency employee Ron Humphrey and his co-conspirator David Troung both received 15 years in prison for espionage. Ms. Yung Krall is a true American hero of Vietnamese decent who fought against communism, despite her father being a top level official of the Hanoi government as Ambassador to Russia.In 1977, a woman called "Keyseat" arrived in Paris with 49 classified U.S. documents. Two days later, Hanoi representatives to the Paris Peace Talks possessed the documents, believing that Keyseat, whose father was a Viet Cong official, was their agent. In the United States in 1982, the Vietnam era's only convicted spies, antiwar activist David Truong and USIA officer Ronald Humphrey, were sentenced for document theft. The main U.S. witness was Keyseat, both a CIA and FBI agent. Yung (then Dung Krall) was Keyseat. Her memoir juxtaposes two phases of her unusual life: her early years in South Vietnam and her adult time as a U.S. Navy wife and career espionage agent. She also provides unique details of village and family customs, patiently describing her childhood, revealing the pain she suffered in a family split by ideology. Yung, anti-Communist from childhood, who shared her mother's views, was also a daughter of Dang Quang Minh, the Viet Cong's ambassador to the Soviet Union, whose life was threatened by his daughter's testimony. Yung led a fast-paced life that in its details rivals spy thriller fiction. A recommended first-person account for larger public collections.<br><i>Margaret W. Norton, J.

She therefore opposed any plan for Darnley to marry her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, who herself claimed to be Queen of England. But in 1565 Mary met and fell in love with Darnley&#x2014;and defied Elizabeth by marrying him. It was not long before she discovered that her new husband was weak and vicious, and interested only in securing sovereign power for himself. <br><br>On February 10, 1567, an explosion at his lodgings left Darnley dead. There were many who might have had a motive for murdering him, not least Mary herself. The intrigue thickened after it was discovered that apparently he had been suffocated before the blast. Emerging from the tragedy were more mysteries than any historian has ever satisfactorily solved.<br><br>Mary and Darnley&#x2019;s marriage had been an adulterous disaster. After Darnley&#x2019;s death, Mary showed favor to the powerful Earl of Bothwell, causing her enemies to accuse her of being his partner in both infidelity and murder. Mary insisted that the murder conspiracy had been aimed at her, and that she had escaped only by changing her plans at the last minute. It has even been suggested that Darnley himself had planned the explosion in order to kill her.<br><br>The murder of Darnley ultimately led to Mary&#x2019;s ruin. After her deposition, there conveniently came to light a box of documents&#x2014;the notorious Casket Letters&#x2014;that her enemies claimed were proof of her guilt. But Mary was never allowed to see them, and they disappeared in 1584. The question of their authenticity has haunted historians ever since.<br><br>After exhaustive reexamination and reevaluation of the source material, Alison Weir has come up with a solution to this enduring mystery that can be substantiated by contemporary evidence, and in the process has shattered many of the misconceptions about Mary, Queen of Scots. Employing once more the bright writing and stunning characterizations that have made her a favorite writer of popular history, Weir has written one of her most engaging excursions into Britain&#x2019;s bloodstained, power-obsessed past.</p><p><b>Alison Weir </b>is the author of four other books on English history, including <b>Eleanor of Aquitaine</b>. She lives outside London with her husband and two children.The Three Crowns<br><br>TO EVERYONE'S DISMAY, THE BABY born to James V of Scotland and his second wife, Marie de Guise, on 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace was a girl. After the deaths of two infant sons in 1541, her father had hoped for another boy to succeed him, because Scotland needed a man's strong hand to rule it. For James V was already mortally ill, and following a crushing defeat by the English at the Battle of Solway Moss on 24 November, he had taken to his bed at Falkland Palace. When news was brought to him of the birth of his daughter, he turned his face to the wall and, recalling that the crown had descended to the Stewart dynasty through Marjorie, daughter of King Robert the Bruce, muttered, "It came from a woman, and it will end in a woman." Soon afterwards he died, "wherefore there was great mourning in Scotland."<br><br>At only six days old, the infant Mary became Queen of Scots. Scotland was used to royal minorities, for every one of its monarchs since 1406 had succeeded as a child. As a result, the nobility had grown in strength and autonomy, having become used to long periods without royal interference during which they enjoyed the unfettered exercise of power. These minorities had also bred rivalries and factions, as different families struggled for power.<br><br>In March 1543, Parliament appointed Mary's cousin and next heir, James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, as Second Person and Governor of the Realm until the Queen attained her majority at the age of twelve. Arran, then twenty-seven, was a Protestant, and head of the powerful Hamilton clan, whose lands straddled Clydesdale and central Scotland. An English envoy described the Hamiltons as a good looking race, but vicious, faithless and inept. Arran's claim to the succession was not undisputed, because there was uncertainty as to whether his parents had been lawfully married; hence his overriding purpose in life was to establish the legality of his claim. Self-interest and the advancement of his House dictated his political policies, but his indolence, instability and lack of decisiveness lost him the support of many nobles.<br><br>The King of England at that time was Henry VIII, and he was resolved to marry his five-year-old son and heir, Prince Edward, to the little Queen of Scots, and thereby unite England and Scotland under Tudor rule. Arran, eager to secure the support of the English King for his claims, was willing to co-operate, and on 1 July 1543 a treaty was concluded at Greenwich, which provided for the marriage of Mary and Edward. Mary was to go to England when she was ten, and be married the following year.<br><br>But the Catholic party in Scotland, led by Marie de Guise and Cardinal David Beaton, were opposed to the treaty. They removed Mary from Arran's care, took her to Stirling Castle, and had her crowned there, in the Chapel Royal, on 9 September. In December, a Catholic-dominated Parliament repudiated Mary's betrothal and renewed the ancient alliance between Scotland and France, England's enemy.<br><br>Henry VIII was incensed, and in 1544 retaliated by sending an army to Scotland. The savage campaign that followed became known as the "rough wooing": in the course of it, scores of towns, villages and abbeys in the south-east were mercilessly sacked and burned, leaving vast swathes of devastation. Even the city of Edinburgh did not escape Henry's fury: he had ordered his commanders to sack, "burn and subvert it, and put every man, woman and child to the sword." Far from bringing the Scots to heel, the barbarity of the English only strengthened them in their resolve.<br><br>In 1543, there had returned to Scotland a man who was to play a prominent role in the drama of Mary, Queen of Scots. Matthew Stuart, 4th Earl of Lennox, whose power base was centred upon Glasgow, had been born in 1516 at Dumbarton, and had succeeded to his earldom at the age of ten, after the murder of his father by Arran's bastard half-brother. This was cause enough for bad blood between Lennox and Arran, but they were also bitter rivals for the succession. Like Arran, Lennox was descended from Mary, daughter of James II, but only in the female line; unlike Arran, he had been born in undisputed wedlock. With such contentious issues dividing them, there could be no friendship between the Lennox Stuarts and the Hamiltons.<br><br>In 1531, Lennox had gone to France, where he joined the royal guard, became a naturalised subject of the French King and changed the spelling of his surname from Stewart to Stuart. Twelve years later, to Arran's consternation, he returned to Scotland and began paying court to Marie de Guise. Like most women, she found him handsome, charming and gallant: he was "a strong man of personage, well-proportioned with lusty and manly visage, and carried himself erect and stately, wherefore he was very pleasant in the sight of gentlewomen." A well-educated man, he spoke fluent French and was skilled at playing the lute. The Queen Dowager and Cardinal Beaton believed Lennox to be an ardent Francophile who would support them against the ambitions of Arran. But Lennox was unreliable, treacherous and driven by self-interest, and when Marie refused to marry him, he defected to the English in search of better prospects. In return for his support against the Scots, Henry VIII bestowed on him the hand of his niece, Lady Margaret Douglas.<br><br>The wedding took place in July 1544 at St. James's Palace in London. Born in 1515, Margaret was the daughter of Henry VIII's elder sister, Margaret Tudor (widow of James IV and grandmother of Mary, Queen of Scots) by her second husband, Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus; Margaret was therefore near in blood to the English throne, and a marriage between her and Lennox could only reinforce the dynastic claims of both parties. Yet although their union was politically advantageous, it was also a love match on both sides: he was said to be "far in love," and in his letters, he addressed his wife as "mine own sweet Madge" or "my Meg," told her she was his "chiefest comfort," and signed himself "Your own Matthieu and most loving husband." Margaret was a devout Catholic, so Lennox, who had been reared in the old faith but recently converted to Protestantism, now tempered his spiritual views to please his wife and King Henry; religion was ever a matter of expediency with him.<br><br>Margaret Douglas was a formidable woman. Beautiful, intelligent, domineering and relentlessly ambitious, she had an alarming talent for dangerous intrigue. She had spent much of her youth at the English court and become a great favourite of her uncle the King, but incurred his anger when she twice, in 1536 and 1541, became involved with unsuitable men; on each occasion Henry sent her for a spell in the Tower, a place with which she was to be become all too familiar during the course of her turbulent life. There can be no doubt that Margaret Douglas became the driving force in the Lennoxes' marriage.<br><br>In 1545, Lennox led an English army into Scotland in the hope of taking Dumbarton Castle for Henry VIII. It was during this campaign that he ordered the slaughter of eleven child hostages whose Scottish fathers had been forced into his ranks and then defected; this earned him undying notoriety and a perpetually haunted conscience. His offensive ended in failure, and on 1 October the Scottish Parliament attainted him for treason and confiscated all his estates and titles, some of which were given to Arran. Lennox was now the most hated man in Scotland. For the next nineteen years, he remained an exile in England, living on the bounty of Henry VIII. The Lennoxes' chief seat was Temple Newsham in Yorkshire, and they owned another house nearby at Settrington. When in London, they resided at the former royal manor of Hackney. Lennox never abandoned hope of regaining his lost lands and asserting his dynastic claims, his ambitions having been sharpened by his grand marriage and the birth of eight children, who inherited the royal blood of both Scotland and England.<br><br>During the 1540s, the impact of the Protestant Reformation began to be felt in Scotland. For decades now, the Catholic Church in Scotland had been morally lax and corrupt, and there had been calls for its reform. Now, religious affiliations became identified with political issues, and two noble factions emerged: the Catholics, who favoured the "auld alliance" with France, and a growing number of Protestants, who wanted closer relations with England, whose King, although a Catholic, had severed links with the Church of Rome and declared himself Supreme Head of the Church of England.<br><br>Trouble began when a Protestant heretic, George Wishart, was burned on the orders of Cardinal Beaton in 1546. In reprisal, Wishart's followers brutally murdered Cardinal Beaton, then held out for a year in St. Andrews Castle before the arrival of a French fleet forced them to surrender. Among those taken prisoner was the reformist preacher John Knox, who would one day become one of the prime movers in the Protestant Reformation. He was sentenced to two years as a galley slave.<br><br>In 1547, when Henry VIII died and was succeeded by the nine-year-old Edward VI, England became a Protestant state. The Lord Protector, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, was determined to carry on the war against Scotland, and ordered another invasion. On 10 September 1547, the Scots under Arran suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, which enabled the English to occupy south-eastern Scotland. On the day after the battle, the Scots hastily moved their little Queen to Inchmahome Priory for safety, and appealed to the French for aid.<br><br>By January 1548, Arran, who had hoped to marry his own son to Mary, was negotiating with King Henry II of France for her marriage to Henry's eldest son, the Dauphin Francis. Mary's maternal uncles, Francis, Duke of Guise and Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine, were rising men at the French court, and they, foreseeing great advantages to themselves through the marriage of their ...</p><h2>The Election of 1876: And the Administration of Rutherford B.

But Chesbro worked hard to keep Mongo as believable as possible as he and his full-size brother, Garth, wandered across an often magical landscape in search of some truly outlandish villains. This time out, the bad guys are the CIA: not just a few rogues but apparently the entire outfit. The Company is afraid that the brothers Frederickson's investigation into some tangled Haitian political murders will derail its plot to assassinate the liberal U.S. president and veep and install the right-wing Speaker of the House in the Oval Office. Said Speaker is described as having risen to power on "a poisonous, rushing tsunami of homophobia, antifeminism, and an entire devil's thesaurus of hysterical code words." Even this familiar premise might have been swallowable if Chesbro didn't stop every few pages to decry everything from the Aldrich Ames case to assault weapons. Readers who agree politically with Mongo will find the hysteria and vivisection tough going here; others will probably give up early. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Many of Chesbro's popular Mongo novels have featured megalomaniacs so ludicrously implausible that they might have emerged from a Batman comic book. This time out, the estimable dwarf--who also happens to be a former circus aerialist, martial artist, and world-renowned Ph.D. criminologist--is only battling the CIA, neo-Nazis, and Haitian voodoo terrorists, and the enhanced plausibility of the opposition makes the tale even more fun than usual. The premise is that Haiti has long been a wholly owned "asset" of a group of renegade CIA crazies who are plotting the assassination of the president and vice-president so that the right-wing Speaker of the House (a thinly veiled caricature of Newt Gingrich) will ascend to the Oval Office and will promptly put gays, people of color, pro-choice activists, and sundry others in their places--at the back of the bus, or under it. Even those faithful Mongo fans who may prefer Batman villains to almost-real-life bad guys will enjoy the ride. <i>Thomas Gaughan</i></p><h2>Mixed Blessings: New Art in a Multicultural America</h2><p><p>The New Press is proud to publish a new paperback edition of <i>Mixed Blessings</i>, the first book to discuss the cross-cultural process taking place in the work of contemporary Latino, Native, African, and Asian American artists. Rich with illustrations of artworks in many different media, and filled with incisive quotes and unsettling reports, it is more than a book about art; it is a complex meditation on the relationships of people to their cultures. Lucy R. Lippard, one of our most original and insightful writers on art, challenges conventional approaches and explores the role of images in a changing society. Among her subjects are the uncertainty of exile; the confusion of identity in attempts to climb out of the melting pot; and art that speaks for itself, reversing stereotypes and reclaiming history and memory. The New Press edition features a new introduction by Lippard that reconsiders the issues first presented in <i>Mixed Blessings </i> when it appeared in 1990 and evaluates the state of multicultural art today.</p><br></p><p>In America today there is a little-known explosion of creative art by women and men from many different ethnic backgrounds.

Long ago, through a combination of timing, talent, genius, energy, and publicity, he made the key transition from proper noun to adjective that confirms celebrity and true stature. It is a rare film watcher indeed who cannot define "Hitchcockian." </p><p> As the director of such films as <i>Psycho</i>, <i>North by Northwest</i>, <i>Spellbound</i>, <i>Vertigo</i>, <i>Rear Window</i>, <i>To Catch a Thief</i>, <i>Notorious</i>, and <i>The Birds</i>, Hitchcock has become synonymous with both stylish, sophisticated suspense and mordant black comedy. He was one of the most interviewed directors in the history of film. Among the hundreds of interviews he gave, those in this collection catch Hitchcock at key moments of transition in his long career--as he moved from silent to sound pictures, from England to America, from thrillers to complex romances, and from director to producer-director. </p><p> These conversations dramatize his shifting attitudes on a variety of cinematic matters that engaged and challenged him, including the role of stars in a movie, the importance of story, the use of sound and color, his relationship to the medium of television, and the attractions and perils of realism. </p><p> His engaging wit and intelligence are on display here, as are his sophistication, serious contemplation, and playful manipulation of the interviewer.</p></p><p><p>A collection of interviews with the director who has become synonymous with both stylish, sophisticated suspense and mordant black comedy</p>Sidney Gottlieb, a professor of English at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut, is the editor of <i>Hitchcock on Hitchcock: Selected Writings and Interviews</i>.</p><h2>Munchkin Vol. 6 (6)</h2><p>Kill the monsters.

The account of his childhood, rise and fall is candid, scrupulous and unsparing. Major&#39;s early life was extraordinary; his rise through Parliament meteoric. Soon a favourite of Margaret Thatcher, he became Foreign Secretary and then Chancellor of the Exchequer. When Thatcher fell, he fought and won a shrewd campaign to succeed her, and went on to win a remarkable general election victory in 1992. He brought down inflation and ushered in a solid economic recovery, yet within months of the 1992 election, his government was in troubled waters. John Major is candid about his fight to keep sterling in the ERM and his reactions to &#39;Black Wednesday&#39;. He is frank about the civil war within his party over Britain&#39;s relationship with the EU. He is honest about what he won and what he lost, about friends and foes within his party as well as outside.</p><p><p>John Major has been Conservative Member of Parliament for Huntington since 1979. He served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer before succeeding Margaret Thatcher as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister in November 1990.

Yet she still believes there is a chance for happiness, and she waits patiently for the moment when her life will turn from sorrowful longing to joy.

Clinging to the bottle for comfort, she becomes a tragic figure who speaks frankly about the human condition.

They met with determined resistance from several tribes but nobody defied them with more determination and skill than Viriathus. Apparently of humble birth, he emerged as a leader after the treacherous massacre of the existing tribal chieftains and soon proved himself a gifted and audacious commander.<br><br>Relying on hit and run guerrilla tactics, he inflicted repeated humiliating reverses upon the theoretically superior Roman forces, uniting a number of tribes in resistance to the invader and stalling their efforts at conquest and pacification for eight years. Still unbeaten in the field, he was only overcome when the Romans resorted to bribing some of his own men to assassinate him (though they reneged on the agreed payment, claiming they did not reward traitors!). <br> <br>Though renowned in his day Viriathus has been neglected by modern historians, a travesty that Luis Silva puts right in this thoroughly researched and accessible account. Portuguese by birth, the author draws on Portuguese research and perspectives that will be refreshing to English-language scholars and his own military experience also informs his analysis of events.

First, Mimi and Joe introduce Isabel to Tom Bruce&#x2013;a bigwig back home in Texas. The roving eye of Tom&#x2019;s young fiancï¿½e leads Isabel to believe that money may be at the root of her love for Tom. But what, Isabel wonders, is at the root of Tom&#x2019;s interest in Isabel herself? Then there are the feelings that Isabel has for Jamie, which are certainly hard to ignore. And she mustn&#x2019;t forget about her niece, Cat, who&#x2019;s busy falling for a man whom Isabel suspects of being an incorrigible mama&#x2019;s boy. <br><br> Of course, Jamie counsels Isabel to stay out of it all, but there are irresistible philosophical issues at stake&#x2013;when to tell the truth and when to keep one&#x2019;s mouth shut, to be precise&#x2013;and philosophical issues are meat and drink to Isabel Dalhousie, editor of the <i>Review of Applied Ethics</i>. In any case, Isabel is certain of the ethical basis for a little sleuthing now and again&#x2013; especially when the problems involve matters of the heart.</p><p>Alexander McCall Smith is the author of, in the Isabel Dalhousie series, <i>The Sunday Philosophy Club</i> and <i>Friends, Lovers, Chocolate</i>. He is also the author of the international phenomenon <i>The No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency</i> series. He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and has served on many national and international bodies concerned with bioethics.CHAPTER ONE<br><br> To take an interest in the affairs of others is entirely natural; so natural, in fact, that even a cat, lying cat-napping on top of a wall, will watch with half an eye the people walking by below. But between such curiosity, which is permissible, and nosiness, which is not, there lies a dividing line that some people simply miss&#x2014;even if it is a line that is painted red and marked by the very clearest of warning signs.<br><br> Isabel adjusted the position of her chair. She was sitting in the window of the Glass and Thompson cafï¿½ at the top of Dundas Street&#x2014;where it descended sharply down the hill to Canonmills. From that point in the street, one could see in the distance the hills of Fife beyond: dark-green hills in that light, but at times an attenuated blue, softened by the sea&#x2014;always changing. Isabel liked this cafï¿½, where the display windows of the shop it had once been had now been made into sitting areas for customers. Edinburgh was normally too chilly to allow people to sit out while drinking their coffee, except for a few short weeks in the high summer when cafï¿½ life spilled out onto the pavement, tentatively, as if expecting a rebuff from the elements. This was a compromise&#x2014;to sit in the window, protected by glass, and yet feel part of what was going on outside.<br><br> She edged her chair forwards in order to see a little more of what was happening on the other side of the road, at a slight angle. Dundas Street was a street of galleries. Some were well established, such as the Scottish Gallery and the Open Eye, others were struggling to make a living on the work of young artists who still believed that great things lay ahead. Most of them would be disappointed, of course, as they discovered that the world did not share their conviction, but they tried nonetheless, and continued to try. One of these smaller galleries was hosting an opening and Isabel could see the crowd milling about within. At the front door stood a small knot of smokers, drawing on cigarettes, bound together in their exclusion. She strained to make out the features of one of them, a tall man wearing a blue jacket, who was talking animatedly to a woman beside him, gesturing to emphasise some private point. He looked vaguely familiar, she decided, but it was difficult to tell from that distance and angle. Suddenly the man in the blue jacket stopped gesturing, reached forward and rested a hand on the woman&#x2019;s shoulder. She moved sideways, as if to shrug him off, but he held on tight. Her hand went up in what seemed to be an attempt to prise off his fingers, but all the time she was smiling&#x2014;Isabel could see that. Strange, she thought; an argument conducted in the language of smiles.<br><br> But more intriguing still: an expensive car, one of those discreet cars of uncertain make but with unambiguous presence, had drawn up on the cafï¿½ side of the street, just below the level of Isabel&#x2019;s window. It had stopped and a man and a woman had emerged. They were in a no-parking zone, and Isabel watched as the man pressed the device on his key ring that would lock the doors automatically. You are allowed to drop things off, thought Isabel, but not park. Don&#x2019;t you know that? And then she thought: People who drive cars like that consider themselves above the regulations, the rules that prevent those with humbler cars, and shallower pockets, from parking. And these people, of course, can afford the parking fines; small change for them. She found herself feeling irritated, and her irritation became, after a few moments, animosity. She found herself disliking them, this man and woman standing beside their expensive car, because of their arrogance.<br><br> She looked down into her coffee cup, and then up again. No, she thought. This is wrong. You should not dislike people you do not know. And she knew nothing about them, other than that they appeared to imagine that their wealth entitled them to ignore the regulations by which the rest of us had to abide. But then they might not know that one could not park there because they were from somewhere else; from a place where a double yellow line might be an invitation to park, for all she knew. And even as she thought this, she realised that of course they were not from Edinburgh. Their clothes were different, and their complexions too. These people had been in the sun somewhere, and their clothes had that cut, that freshly dry-cleaned look that Scottish clothes never seem to have. Scottish clothes are soft, a bit crumpled, lived-in, like Scottish people themselves really.<br><br> She craned her neck. The two of them, the man considerably older than the woman, were walking down the road, away from the car. They paused as the man pointed at a door, and the woman said something to him. Isabel saw her adjust the printed silk scarf around her neck and glance at the watch on her wrist, a small circle of gold that caught the sun as she moved her arm. The man nodded and they climbed the steps that led into the Scottish Gallery. Isabel sat back in her seat. It was not remarkable in any way; a wealthy couple from somewhere else, driving into town, leaving their car where they should not&#x2014;but out of ignorance rather than arrogance&#x2014;and then going into one of the galleries. There was nothing particularly interesting about all that, except for one thing. Isabel had seen the man&#x2019;s face, which was drawn up on one side from Bell&#x2019;s palsy, producing the condition&#x2019;s characteristic grimace. And the woman&#x2019;s face had been, by contrast, a beautiful one&#x2014;if one&#x2019;s standards of beauty are the regular features of the Renaissance Madonna: soft, composed, feminine.<br><br> They are none of my business, she thought. And yet she had nothing to do until twelve o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;it was then ten-thirty in the morning&#x2014;and she had been half thinking of going into the Scottish Gallery anyway. She knew the staff there, and they usually showed her something interesting by the Scottish artists she liked, a Peploe sketch, a Philipson nude, something by William Crosbie if she was in luck. If she went in now, she would see the couple at closer quarters and reach a more considered view. She had been wrong to dislike them, and she owed it to them now to find out a little bit more about them. So it was not pure curiosity, even if it looked like it; this was really an exercise in rectifying a mistaken judgement.<br> The entrance to the Scottish Gallery was a glass door, behind which a short set of open stairs led to the upper gallery, while a slightly longer set led down into a warren of basement exhibition spaces. These lower spaces were not dark, as basements could be, but brightly lit by strategically placed display lights, and brightened, too, by the splashes of colour on the walls. Isabel went up and passed the desk of her friend Robin McClure to her right. He sat there with his list of prices and his catalogues, ready to answer questions. What impressed her about Robin was that although he could tell who bought paintings and who did not, he was civil to both. So those who wandered into the gallery because it was wet outside, or because they just wanted to look at art, would receive from him as courteous a welcome as those who wandered in with the intention of buying a painting or, in the case of those who were weaker, a readiness to be tempted to buy. That, thought Isabel, was what distinguished Dundas Street galleries from many of the expensive galleries in London and Paris, where bells had to be rung before the door was opened. And even then, once the door had been unlocked, the welcome, if it was a welcome, was grudging and suspicious.<br><br> Robin was not at his desk. She glanced around her. It was a general exhibition, one where a hotchpotch of works were displayed. The effect, thought Isabel, was pleasing, and her eye was drawn immediately to a large picture dominating one of the walls. Two figures were before a window, a man and a woman. The man was staring out at a rural landscape, the woman looked in towards the room. Her face was composed, but there was a wistful sadness about it. She would like to be elsewhere, thought Isabel; as so many people would. How many of us are happy to be exactly where we are at any moment? Auden said something about that, she remembered, in his mountains poem. He had said that the child unhappy on one side of the Alps might wish himself on the other. Well, he was right; only the completely happy think that they are in the correct place.<br><br> She glanced about her. There were several people on the main floor of the gallery: a man in a blue overcoat, a scarf around his neck, peering at a small painting near the window; a couple of middle-aged women wearing those green padded jackets that marked them immediately as leading, or at least aspiring to, the country life. They were sisters, Isabel decided, because they had the same prominent brow; sisters living together, thoroughly accustomed to each other, acting&#x2014;almost thinking&#x2014;in unison. But where were the man and the woman she had seen? She took a few steps forwards, away from the top of the stairs, and saw that they were standing in the small inner gallery that led off from the main floor. He was standing in front of a painting, consulting a catalogue; she was by the window staring out. It was the reverse of the large painting that she had spotted when she came in. She was looking out; he was looking in. But then it occurred to Isabel that in other respects the scene before her echoed the painting. This woman wanted to be elsewhere.<br><br> &#x201c;Isabel?&#x201d;<br><br> She turned round sharply. Robin McClure stood behind her, looking at her enquiringly. He reached out and put a hand lightly on her arm in a gesture of greeting.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re standing in awe before our offering. Overwhelmed by the beauty of it all.&#x201d;<br><br> Isabel laughed. &#x201c;Overcome.&#x201d;<br><br> Robin, his hand still on her arm, guided her towards a small picture at the edge of the room. Isabel glanced over her shoulder into the smaller room; they were still there, although the man had now joined the woman at the window, where they seemed absorbed in conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s something that will appeal to you,&#x201d; said Robin. &#x201c;Look at that.&#x201d;<br><br> Isabel knew immediately. &#x201c;Alberto Morrocco?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br> Robin nodded. &#x201c;You can see the influence, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br> It was not apparent to Isabel. She leaned forward to look more closely at the painting. A girl sat in a chair, one arm resting on a table, the other holding a book. The girl looked straight ahead; not at the viewer, but through him, beyond him. She was wearing a tunic of the sort worn by schoolgirls in the past, a grey garment, with thick folds in the cloth. Behind her, a curtain was blown by the wind from an open window.<br><br> &#x201c;Remember Falling Leaves?&#x201d; Robin prompted. &#x201c;That painting by James Cowie?&#x201d;<br><br> Isabel looked again at the painting. Yes. Schoolgirls. Cowie had painted schoolgirls, over and over, innocently, but the paintings had contained a hint of the anxious transition to adolescence.<br><br> &#x201c;Morrocco studied under Cowie in Aberdeen,&#x201d; Robin continued. &#x201c;He later discovered his own palette and the bright colours came in. And the liveliness. But every so often he remembered who taught him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Morrocco was a friend of your father&#x2019;s, wasn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; Isabel said. Scotland was like that; there were bonds and connections everywhere, sinews of association, and they were remembered. Isabel had a painting by Robin&#x2019;s father, David McClure; it was one of her favourites.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Robin. &#x201c;They were great friends. And I have known Morrocco ever since I can remember.&#x201d;<br><br> Isabel reached out, as if to touch the surface of the painting. &#x201c;That awful cloth,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The stuff that schoolgirls had to wear.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Most uncomfortable,&#x201d; said Robin. &#x201c;Or so I imagine.&#x201d;<br><br> Isabel pointed to the painting beside it, a small still life of a white-and-blue Glasgow jug. There was something familiar about the style, but she could not decide what it was. Perhaps it was the jug itself; there were so many paintings of Glasgow jugs&#x2014;to paint one, it seemed, had been a rite of passage, like going to Paris. Artists, she thought, were enthusiastic imitators, a thought that immediately struck her as unfair, she conceded to herself, because everyone was an enthusiastic imitator.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Robin. &#x201c;Well, there you are . . .&#x201d; He turned his head. The man whom Isabel had seen had left the inner gallery and was standing a few steps away from Robin, wanting to speak, but reluctant to interrupt.<br><br> &#x201c;Sir . . . ,&#x201d; began Robin, then faltered. Isabel saw his expression, the slight air of being taken aback and the quick recovery. And she thought: This is what this man must experience every time he meets somebody; the shock as the distorted face is registered and then follows the attempt to cover the reaction. She remembered how she had once had lunch with a young man, the nephew of a friend of hers, who had come to seek her advice about studying philosophy at university. She had met him for the first time in a restaurant. He had come in, a self-possessed, good-looking young man, and when they had moved to the table she had seen the scar which ran down the side of his cheek. He had said immediately: &#x201c;I was bitten by a dog when I was a boy. I was thirteen.&#x201d; He had said that because he had known what she was thinking&#x2014;how did it happen? Presumably everybody thought that and he supplied the answer right at the beginning, just to get it out of the way.<br><br> The man fingered his tie nervously. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to interrupt,&#x201d; he said. Then, turning to Isabel, he repeated, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I didn&#x2019;t wish to interrupt.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We were just blethering,&#x201d; said Robin, using the Scots word. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;<br><br> He&#x2019;s American, thought Isabel, from somewhere in the South. But it was difficult to tell these days because peo- ple moved about so much and accents had changed. And she thought of her late mother, suddenly, inconsequentially, her sainted American mother as she called her, who had spoken in the accent of Louisiana, and whose voice had faded in her memory, though it was still there, just.<br><br> She looked at the man and then quickly turned away. She was curious about him, of course, but if she held him in her gaze he would think that she was staring at his face. She moved away slightly, to indicate that he should talk to Robin.<br><br> &#x201c;Isabel,&#x201d; said Robin. &#x201c;Would you mind?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d;<br><br> She left Robin talking to the man while she went off to examine more paintings. She noticed that the woman had also come out of the smaller gallery and was now standing in front of an Elizabeth Blackadder oil of the Customs Building in Venice.<br><br> &#x201c;Elizabeth Blackadder. She&#x2019;s a very popular artist,&#x201d; said Isabel casually. &#x201c;Or at least on this side of the Atlantic. I&#x2019;m not sure whether people know about her on your side.&#x201d;<br><br> The woman was surprised. She turned to face Isabel. &#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Black what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Blackadder,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;She lives here in Edinburgh.&#x201d;<br><br> The woman looked back at the painting. &#x201c;I like it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know where you are with a painting like that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Venice,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you are.&#x201d;<br><br> The woman was silent for a moment. She had been bending to look more closely at the painting; now she straightened up. &#x201c;How did you know that I was American?&#x201d; she asked. Her tone was even, but it seemed to Isabel that there was an edge to her voice.<br><br> &#x201c;I was over there when your . . . your husband spoke,&#x201d; she said quickly. &#x201c;I assumed.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And assumed correctly,&#x201d; said the woman. There was no warmth in her voice.<br><br> &#x201c;You see,&#x201d; continued Isabel, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m half-American myself. Half-American, half-Scottish, although I&#x2019;ve hardly ever spent any time in the States. My mother was from&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> ...</p><h2>Something in disguise</h2><p>Mary&#39;s second marriage to Colonel Herbert Brown-Lacey is turning out to be a terrible mistake.

The Cazalet Chronicles - The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, Casting Off and All Change - have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and for BBC Radio 4.

She died, aged ninety, at home in Suffolk on 2 January 2014.Once again Chivers has revived a fine book that has long been out of print. British actress Eleanor Bron does it full justice as she tells the story of a widow with two grown children who has married a pompous bore. But he is also decent and reliable. Or is he? Here the narrator has interpreted his true nature, not by any revelatory dramatic performance, but by a subtle reading of the double-edged dialogue throughout. With such convincing narration, who cares if the book itself ever comes back in print? J.C.

In Dragon Gets By , groggy Dragon has a mixed-up day. He reads an egg, fries his morning paper, and sweeps his dirt floor until it becomes a basement. Finally, exhausted, he goes to sleep, but only after watering his bed and curling up on his plants. In A Friend for Dragon , the lonely fellow, encouraged by an unseen mischievous snake, adopts an apple for a friend. Once the snake is gone, the apple's conversation is limited, but Dragon finds many good qualities in his new pal--it is a good listener and it is always willing to share. Unfortunately, the apple is left unattended and is devoured by a hungry walrus. A heartbroken Dragon buries his friend but his loneliness is short-lived. An apple falls on his head and Dragon looks up to see a treeful of round, red friends. The gentle humor of these stories is accentuated by Pilkey's simple but engaging cartoons. Swirls and dots bejewel the skies, giving the pictures a colorful, childlike appeal. Dragon's good-natured naivete should win him many new friends. --Lori A.

It isn&#x2019;t the first place you&#x2019;d expect to find leaders starting a fire&#x2014;let alone purposefully. But Mandar Apte, head of the company&#x2019;s Empower training program, isn&#x2019;t just tasked with sparking positive change worldwide. He&#x2019;s specifically charged with setting executives&#x2019; creativity and capacity to innovate ablaze.</p><p>Empower classes aren&#x2019;t grounded in traditional business processes and procedures, though. Instead, they revolve around a simple principle: To succeed in increasingly unpredictable and uncertain environments, we can&#x2019;t simply remain static. Rather, we must constantly change, adapt, and strive to fan the sparks of innovation.</p><p>But doing this is much easier said than done.</p><p>In fact, while preparing hundreds of executives to face tomorrow&#x2019;s challenges, Apte&#x2019;s team has made some surprising discoveries about the common problems modern professionals face. Rather than a lack of time, money, or manpower, many stem from two unlikely sources, he says. Specifically: a lack of risk tolerance and a resistance to change.</p><p>Going into Empower training sessions, Apte just assumes everyone is capable of being an innovator. In today&#x2019;s hyperkinetic and hypercompetitive world, he argues, we&#x2019;re all forced to constantly adapt and readapt. So he always begins classes by asking a simple question, What&#x2019;s keeping you from being more innovative? Often, he finds, the biggest stumbling block is simply our own sense of perspective.</p><p>When we reexamine the difficulties that we confront more closely, we often find several obstacles that prevent us from successfully adapting to and overcoming unforeseen hurdles. These barriers to success include fear, anxiety, insecurity, and others&#x2019; opinions.</p><p>If you&#x2019;ve ever run up against these barriers in your own life and business, you&#x2019;re not alone; we all have at one time or another. We all want to reduce stress, be more productive, and better serve our organizations and customers. But to achieve these goals, we must confront the very same issues that Apte outlines, any one or all of which routinely prevent us from realizing our objectives.</p><p>Whether we&#x2019;re speaking about individuals or organizations, our perceptions impact our ability to make sound decisions, our willingness to take risks, and ultimately our performance. And all of these factors have a direct effect on our ability to succeed.</p><p>But as Shell&#x2019;s Empower program teaches, we all hold the keys to effectively adapt with changing times and get ahead more frequently in life and business as well. Change your outlook, and you can change your future. Rather than look outside at shifting times and trends to do so, as we would in traditional problem-solving scenarios, this transformation process starts by taking a deeper look within.</p><p>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½</p><p>It&#x2019;s no secret that change is all around us, and in business especially it seems that the scope, breadth, and speed of changes taking place today are boundless. This means that throughout your life and organization, the scope, breadth, and speed of changes you should be making to keep up, let alone get ahead, should be equally limitless.</p><p>Change in business can take the form of:</p><ul><li>Unstable economic conditions</li><li>Unpredictable operating environments</li><li>Shifting competitive landscapes</li><li>Changing customer needs and expectations</li><li>New tools, trends, and techniques</li><li>Emerging technologies (especially information technologies)</li><li>New communications systems</li><li>Evolving best practices</li><li>Unexpected opportunities and challenges</li></ul><p>And that&#x2019;s just to name a few common varieties.</p><p>In effect, this rapidly accelerating rate of change (driven by continued advances in IT and personal communications) has greatly compounded the challenges we face. We now cross paths with a rapidly ballooning number of individuals and engage in numerous interactions and cross-reactions as a result of every action we take. The result is an unprecedented and truly radical degree of uncertainty in professional environments. We&#x2019;re quickly discovering that the present is growing more unstable and the future is increasingly difficult to predict.</p><p>In short, the world of business is a risky place to be, and looking these risks squarely in the eye&#x2014;then pushing them out of the way&#x2014;can seem intimidating. But that&#x2019;s exactly what we must do, even if it means routinely stepping outside the comfort zones we operate in. It&#x2019;s the only way to continually thrive on both an individual and an organizational level.</p><p>Hesitate to change or take smart risks, and no matter how pragmatic we believe ourselves to be, we&#x2019;re often unwittingly working at cross purposes. When we allow fears and anxieties to color our decisions and doubts to govern our actions, we often tie our own hands and directly inhibit our ability to grow and innovate.</p><p>Happily, because all of these shackles are self-imposed, we all have the power to unlock them the moment we elect to do so. Choose to remove emotion from the equation and put fear in the backseat, and you&#x2019;ll take the first, most powerful step toward future-proofing yourself or your enterprise and begin to tear down the stumbling blocks that stand between you and your ultimate success. Embrace change by taking calculated risks and meaningful action, and you&#x2019;ll put yourself on the path to regular reinvention&#x2014;the essence of remaining relevant&#x2014;and create positive, lasting effects on every level.</p><p>Nonetheless, many enterprises and professionals still struggle to cope with change, even as others seem to thrive in turbulent markets. As you&#x2019;ll soon discover, the secret to leaders&#x2019; ongoing success has little to do with individual ability or business environments. Rather, the source of their continued achievements frequently lies in their own willingness to change, grow, and embrace fresh perspectives.</p><p>Are you looking to dive headfirst into tomorrow, spark lasting change, and set yourself on the fast-track to becoming future-proof? Step back and calmly study the challenges before you, then take smart action. When you remove worry and doubt from the decision-making process, you may be surprised just how easy it is to sidestep the obstacles.</p><p>This book provides a new approach for making things work&#x2014;in your personal life, your career, and your business. Apply its principles, and you can consistently find success with just a few simple shifts in thinking, even in the most fast-changing and unpredictable environments.</p><p>As will become evident throughout this book:</p><ul><li>Everyone is an innovator.</li><li>Change is your secret weapon.</li><li>Disruption drives learning, growth, and success.</li><li>Relevancy is reinvention.</li><li>Flexibility makes you future-proof.</li></ul><p>Put simply, innovation isn&#x2019;t hard. In fact, small changes (evolutions) can be every bit as powerful as huge breakthroughs (revolutions). Moreover, the same strategic principles that today&#x2019;s most-acclaimed strategic innovators use to produce game-changing advancements can be leveraged to help you positively transform your life, business, and career on every level.</p><p>When the average working professionals you&#x2019;ll meet in this book found their careers stalling out or were struggling to make ends meet, they took simple, practical steps that drove them closer to achieving their goals&#x2014;then repeated them time and again.</p><p>And when the many businesses of all sizes profiled in the following pages found that their industry had become more challenging or that competitors were nipping at their heels, they asserted their leadership position by doing the same as well.</p><p>Case in point: When Target wanted to boost its profits, it didn&#x2019;t build more big-box retail outlets. It launched half-size stores in fast-growing urban markets selling half-size packs of paper towels and locally branded merchandise.</p><p>When the Danish supermarket SuperBrugsen wanted to differentiate itself and stay competitive in increasingly demanding markets, it simply asked customers what locally branded food products they wanted it to stock.</p><p>When medical device manufacturer Medtronic wanted to create growth opportunities, it didn&#x2019;t double down on more cutting-edge defibrillators. Instead, it partnered with hospitals to open on-site laboratories, then&#x2014;building on the trust it had gained&#x2014;grew its new business lines even further by providing these partners with IT, support, and management services.</p><p>None of these innovations is outside your reach. None of these companies reinvented the wheel either: As we periodically do with our cars&#x2019; tires to achieve better performance, they simply gave themselves a purposeful realignment. Slight changes in strategy or perspective can often make a big difference.</p><p>Throughout this book, you&#x2019;ll learn why courageously embracing change and adapting to shifting environments isn&#x2019;t just crucial but the only proven recipe for lasting success for individuals (whether your career is skyrocketing or stalling) and businesses (whether your market is booming or becoming increasingly risky) alike.</p><p>All of us possess the capacity to change, grow, and exert more positive control over our future and do so by practicing small acts of bravery. It all starts with greater awareness, greater flexibility, and greater ability to take action in the face of doubt or indecision.</p><p>In later chapters, you&#x2019;ll learn several of life&#x2019;s little secrets:</p><ul><li>Change isn&#x2019;t as difficult as it seems.</li><li>The status quo is no longer a safe bet.</li><li>Cleverness creates competitive advantage.</li><li>Different isn&#x2019;t just good&#x2014;it&#x2019;s essential.</li></ul><p>But most important, you&#x2019;ll discover that courage is a characteristic that we can actively cultivate in ourselves, nurture through repeated application, and consistently put to work to help us more frequently and successfully change and innovate.</p><p>Take it from master magician Harry Houdini, who, decades ago, mastered the art of bravery by making dozens of daring escapes from sealed tanks of water or submerged coffins.</p><p>&#x201c;My chief task has been to conquer fear,&#x201d; the illusionist once explained. &#x201c;The public sees only the thrill of the accomplished trick. They have no conception of the tortuous preliminary self-training that was necessary to conquer fear . . . no one except myself can appreciate how I have to work at this job every single day, never letting up for a moment. I always have on my mind the thought that next year I must do something greater, something more wonderful.&#x201d;1</p><p>The abilities and opportunities you&#x2019;ll unlock when you find the courage to innovate and make positive changes will appear nothing short of magical as well.</p><p>Over the course of this book, you&#x2019;ll discover just how easy it is to tap into these abilities, and that so-called daredevils and mavericks are secretly neither, being far more risk averse than they are risk-takers.</p><p>Troubled by growing uncertainty? Dubious about the future? Deeply concerned with rising levels of competition? Prepare to put these problems behind you.</p><p>In the pages that follow, I&#x2019;ll show you how to rethink risk, reconsider change, and redefine what it means to be fearless . . . and how to future-proof yourself and your enterprise in the process.</p><br><b>Chapter One</b><br><p>What&#x2019;s Holding You Back?</p><p>Twenty-six-year-old Vermonter Melissa Kirmayer Eamer was sick of serving customers clam chowder. After spending five years slinging chow in the restaurant she co-owned with her former husband, she wanted a bigger bite out of life. Every day, Eamer longed for something better. Every day, she felt more stuck.</p><p>&#x201c;I really hit a point where the restaurant business was challenging, but not intellectually challenging,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It was exhausting, but I felt like I was missing something.&#x201d;1 In retrospect, she discovered that the absent pieces were simply courage and self-confidence.</p><p>She was afraid of change. What if she ruined her life? Her career? Her finances? Eamer felt trapped. She convinced herself that there were too many challenges and the stakes were too high in charting a new professional course. Without relevant contacts and work experience, how could she ever make the shift to a new career? But one day, fed up, she told herself it was now or never: Something had to give. She took a long, hard look in the mirror and asked herself, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the worst that can happen?&#x201d; and &#x201c;What step can I take today to get me started on my path?&#x201d; Then she took that step.</p><p>Eamer had long been interested in the publishing business. So she sent her rï¿½sumï¿½ to several local firms. None responded. Undeterred by this silence, she changed course, offering to work free for six months. This time, two companies agreed. She picked her favorite and signed up. Working at the restaurant by day and the publishing company by night, she tried not to think too far ahead. &#x201c;I might have been overwhelmed by the challenges if I let myself think about it too much,&#x201d; she explains. &#x201c;Instead, I took this incremental step.&#x201d;</p><p>By the end of the internship, she was hired to a paying position working directly with the CEO, an MBA with impressive business acumen.

Surprisingly, they receive a job just before Christmas to protect a gorgeous Greek celebrity singer named Minerva from recent death threats. Turns out, she is a coldhearted beauty who only cares about two things&#x2013;money and Minerva. When shots are fired and a body is found strangled, all kinds of trouble ensues between Minerva, her aging husband, her manager, the Diamond Brothers, and the police. There are a few suggestive references to Minerva's appearance and her silver-plated breasts but nothing more racy or graphic. The witty banter between the characters keeps this short novel moving at breakneck speed. Tim's literal misinterpretations of everything are absurdly funny, and Nick's skill at solving the crime before anyone else, including the police, is entertaining. Horowitz is a master of tongue-in-cheek wit and groan-worthy puns that both sophisticated young mystery readers and older fans will enjoy.<i>&#x2013;Madeline J.

Intimidated by his French school and its prickly teachers, oppressed by gray and wintry Paris, and feeling curiously remote from his father--who spends more and more time staring dully into his computer screen--Oliver longs to return to America.</p><p>Award-winning adult author <i>Adam Gopnik</i>'s first children's book, an adventure set in modern day Paris starring an American boy who finds himself at the center of a war between window and mirror spirits, is an mixed bag of fantasy, technology and history that doesn't quite hang together as a whole. One January evening, eleven-year-old Oliver receives a vision in his bedroom window of a young boy in 17th century dress. This apparition informs him that he is the new King in the Window, a hero elected by kind window wraiths to assist them in their centuries-long war with the soul-stealing evil mirror spirits. Soon, Oliver finds himself in The Way, or the parallel universe on the other side of mirrors. Here, he engages in battle with the diabolical Master of Mirrors, chats with Nostradamus, and helps rescue an elderly Alice in Wonderland. In addition, there is a subplot concerning a super computer atop the Eiffel Tower! , an examination of 17th century French court life, and an on-going discussion of quantum physics. Whew! Gopnik's promising premise quickly sinks under the weight of top-heavy symbolism, arcane literary references, and a seemingly endless supply of quirky characters. As a result, the narrative loses its thread, and ultimately, it's target middle grade audience, who will be unable to tie together the divergent strands of this convoluted tale.

Before they leave, Doug's friend warns him to stay away from the shadowy woods or the "beasties" will get him. It's not long before the siblings are lured into an underground passage and meet up with the creatures. At this point, the hairs on readers' arms will start to rise and the plot takes the bizarre twist so familiar in Sleator's titles. Doug, presented with several dilemmas, is forced to make uncomfortable decisions without really understanding his choices. Using his trademark techniques, Sleator sets the scene within everyday situations, introduces unusual plot elements with vivid description, develops the story line by leading readers though a labyrinth, and builds to an explosive ending with a message. The Beasties follows this format and includes sibling rivalry, forest conservation, respect for those who are less valued or understood, choices and decisions, friendship, and a healthy dose of the creepy. This is a quick read, with lots of suspense, but its real effectiveness lies in the way it introduces and explores issues of human choice and compassion, and the lingering questions after the reading is complete. The Beasties invites discussion as it delves into issues for which there are no easy answers. Sure to be popular with the author's many fans and a good choice to introduce his work to others.?Molly S.

At Cambridge University he formed a friendship with J. S. Henslow, a professor of botany, and that association, along with his enthusiasm for collecting beetles, led to &#x201c;a burning zeal,&#x201d; as he wrote in his&nbsp;<i>Autobiography</i>, for the natural sciences. When Henslow obtained for him the post of naturalist on H.M.S.&nbsp;<i>Beagle</i>, the course of his life was fixed. The five-year-long voyage to the Southern Hemisphere between 1831 and 1836 would lay the foundation for his ideas about evolution and natural selection. Upon his return Darwin lived in London before retiring to his residence at Down, a secluded village in Kent. For the next forty years he conducted his research there and wrote the works that would change human understanding forever. Knowing of the resistance from the orthodox scientific and religious communities, Darwin published&nbsp;<i>The Origin of Species</i>&nbsp;in 1859 only when another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, independently reached the same conclusions. His other works include&nbsp;<i>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</i>&nbsp;(1871) and&nbsp;<i>Recollections of My Mind and Character</i>, also titled&nbsp;<i>Autobiography</i>&nbsp;(1887). Charles Darwin&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Diary of the Voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle</i>&nbsp;was published posthumously in 1933. Darwin died in 1882; he is buried in Westminster Abbey.Struggle for Existence<p>Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more difficult - at least I have found it so - than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, I am convinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year.</p><p>I should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals in a time of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live.</p></p><h2>Fisherman&#39;s Spring</h2><p>One of the most prolific fly-fishing writers of the twentieth century, Roderick L. Haig-Brown continues his &#34;seasons&#34; cycle with Fisherman&#39;s Spring, a book that is as much about the deep philosophical aspects of fly fishing as it is about fly fishing itself. Readers will learn about the abundance of spring life in the streams of British Columbia while also being treated to Haig-Brown&#39;s thoughtful musings and ideas about the rewards of fly fishing streams.</p><p><b>Roderick L. Haig-Brown</b> (1908 1976) was a conservationist and well-known Canadian writer. He was born in England and found his way to British Columbia as a youth. He spent much of his life fishing rivers around the world and writing about his experiences, and in 1953 he received an honorary doctor of laws (LLD) from the University of British Columbia. He is also the author of <i>Fisherman&#x2019;s Fall</i>, <i>Fisherman&#x2019;s Summer</i>, and <i>Fisherman&#x2019;s Winter</i>.

He is the author of the phenomenally successful Island, Dive and Everest trilogies, the ever-popular Macdonald Hall series and the popular On the Run series. Korman likes to travel and visit students all over North America.Grade 7-10 This zany, but rather pointless, romp pits Simon Irving against his father, vice-president of Interflux corporation, to save a piece of open land next to his high school. While masquerading as contemporary high-school angst, this novel is pure fantasy bordering on the ridiculous at points. Although there are some funny moments at school and passable character development of Simon and his two best friends, girls and women are reduced to cardboard stupidity or, worse yet, clinging boyfriend fiends. Simon's mother is a culinary fool who follows every whimsical new "health" diet that the newspaper prints. She is the continual target of the longest standing joke in the book. The ending, true to form, depends on the absurd antics of another adult, this time Simon's father's boss, to resolve the dilemma of students fighting the insensitive corporation. Thus, the story ends even more pointlessly than it began. It's easy to pass this one by.

Winner of the Western Heritage Award. Reissue.</p><p>If the vast buffalo herds that still roamed Kansas in the mid-19th century were in some sense the heart of the country, then the white pioneers committed some kind of spiritual suicide by wiping them out. So suggests this sprawling and doggedly fanciful tale by the Australian author of The Further Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The central figure in a cast of energized puppets, of whom most are either insane or malicious, is Joe Cobdenillegitimate, half-Indian, fated both by his birth and the buffalo-like hump on his back to be a social outcast. Joe starts his working life as a hunter of buffalo, then regrets his role in their destruction and turns to making cigar-store Indians, while rearing the ingrate son of a pious lunatic. The story includes incest, murder, whoring, drunkenness, opium taking, ghoulish burial and shovelfuls of insanity, as well as a spectral white buffalo, among other echoes of Moby-Dick. Dickens (with whom Matthews has been capriciously compared) could treat reality in a fanciful manner; Matthews treats fancy as though it were reality. His story is enjoyable by dint of its vitality, but also exasperating because of its lack of clarity and substance. BOMC alternate. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.A half-white child is born to a dying Indian woman alone on the Kansas prairie in 1855. Adopted by a Saint Louis doctor, he grows up intelligent, willful, and perhaps cursed. He runs away at 16 and careens through several jobs and much money until trapped as a nursemaid to another precocious brat in a small Kansas town. Hunchbacked, distant, and of alien stock, Joe Cobden lives an unheroic life, but the small insanities he takes part in or meets in that small town are the meat of this tremendous novel. Matthews has taken a dust-blown soap opera and turned it into a character study of warped minds and withered souls, of human nature distilled to essences by isolation. The various people can be as grotesque in their actions as Cobden is in his physique, but nothing seems contrived here. A very compelling book, recommended for most libraries. W.

The torch relay -- that staple of Olympic pageantry -- first opened the summer games in 1936 in Berlin. Proposed by the Nazi Propaganda Ministry, the relay was to carry the symbolism of a new Germany across its route through southeastern and central Europe. Soon after the Wehrmacht would march in jackboots over the same terrain. The Olympic festival was a crucial part of the Nazi regime&#39;s mobilization of power.

The stories are by turn poignant, violent, harsh, tender and desolating.</p><p><br>Trudi Tate is a Fellow of Clare Hall and an Affiliated Lecturer in the Faculty of English, University of Cambridge<br>Written by authors as famous as Woolf, Faulkner, Conrad and Wharton, and by equally talented lesser-knowns, these fascinating short stories immerse the reader in the milieu of WW I. Combatants, civilians, women, men, pacifists and propagandists not only describe the bloodshed, strategizing and paranoia of battle but also illuminate the Great War's subtle and profound effects on culture. Several characters lapse into insanity when war makes reality insupportable. Richard Aldington's Lt. Hall desperately tries to fend off the maddening guilt that haunts him. A seemingly sane man in Wyndham Lewis's tale comes unhinged over a poodle. Others simply detach from the world: Mary Butts's injured soldier holds onto reality through clinging to dreams of gossamer fabric, "crepe de Chine, organdie, aerophane, georgette." For others, the war is a curious liberation, a moment of cathartic potential when misery overturns normalcy. In Sylvia Townsend Warner's brilliant story, a brother and sister (both emotional casualties) find unconventional refuge in each other. Wharton's hilarious tour de force depicts a poor American professor chancing into an unlikely romantic fantasy when a rich English woman mistakes him for a refugee and takes him to her manor. In Radclyffe Hall's story, a lesbian who has never fit in discovers a use for her great physical strength and bravery as a nurse on the front lines. Tate's clear and accessible introduction yields good scholarly insights without academic puffery.

Its detractors call it a varmint and wish it good speed from the Lone Star State and its other natural territories. But its supporters claim that it is the animal kingdom's representative of all that's truly Texan: tough, pioneering, adaptable, and generous in sharing its habitation with others. What is it that sets this quizzical little creature apart from the rest of the animal kingdom?</p> <p>Larry L. Smith and Robin W. Doughty ably answer this question in The Amazing Armadillo: Geography of a Folk Critter. This informative book traces the spread of the nine-banded armadillo from its first notice in South Texas late in the 1840s to its current range east to Florida and north to Missouri. The authors look at the armadillo's natural history and habitat as well as the role of humans in promoting its spread, projecting that the animal is increasing in both range and number, continuing its ecological success in areas where habitat and climate are favorable.</p> <p>The book also contributes to a long-standing research theme in geography&#x2014;the relationship between humans and wildlife. It explores the armadillo's value to the medical community in current research in Hansen's Disease (leprosy) as well as commercial uses, and abuses, of the armadillo in recent times. Of particular note is the author's engaging look at the armadillo as a symbol of popular culture, the efforts now underway to make it a "totem animal" symbolizing the easy-going lifestyles of some Sunbelt cities, and the spread of the craze for armadilliana to other urban centers.</p></p><p>Larry L.

He studies Lynch's talent for blending the bizarre and the normal to emphasize the odd nature of normality itself. Hollywood is often criticized for distorting reality and providing escapist fantasies, but in Lynch's movies, fantasy becomes a means through which the viewer is encouraged to build a revolutionary relationship with the world.<br><br>Considering the filmmaker's entire career, McGowan examines Lynch's play with fantasy and traces the political, cultural, and existential impact of his unique style. Each chapter discusses the idea of impossibility in one of Lynch's films, including the critically acclaimed <i>Blue Velvet</i> and <i>The Elephant Man</i>; the densely plotted <i>Lost Highway</i> and <i>Mulholland Drive</i>; the cult favorite <i>Eraserhead</i>; and the commercially unsuccessful Dune. McGowan engages with theorists from the "golden age" of film studies (Christian Metz, Laura Mulvey, and Jean-Louis Baudry) and with the thought of Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Hegel. By using Lynch's weirdness as a point of departure, McGowan adds a new dimension to the field of auteur studies and reveals Lynch to be the source of a new and radical conception of fantasy.</p><p>Todd McGowan is associate professor of English at the University of Vermont.A well written book combining thoughtful Lynch essays for the thinkers and film fanatics!

Though my family was British, we had many French cousins, and that year we all went over to Paris to see them.</p> <p>There was the magical drive around floodlit Paris; the river trip, the walk down the Champs-Elysees. The smell of Gauloises cigarettes--now gone--and French coffee, the taste of real French cooking, a far cry from the food I knew. I took pictures from the top of the Eiffel Tower, and gazed in rapture at the Napoleonic army of toy soldiers in Les Invalides. And then there was the sound of my cousins speaking French--charming, sensuous, mysterious.</p> <p>But it was something unexpected that impressed me most.</p> <p>My French cousin Isabelle was driving me and my father's elderly aunt. By mistake, she made an illegal turn. The police pounced. Isabelle apologized. The policeman was stony-faced. Then Isabelle had an inspiration.</p> <p>"You see, Monsieur, I was taking my aunt from England for a drive," she explained.</p> <p>The policeman bent down, looked at the little old lady on the back seat, stood at attention and saluted. "Passez, Madame," he said gallantly.</p> <p>We've all encountered occasional rudeness in France, but throw yourself on a French person's mercy, and their sense of chivalry usually kicks in. That's the special charm of France.</p> <p>I stayed with my cousins often after that. One Parisian family lived just up the street from Proust's childhood home, and only yards from where the Statue of Liberty was constructed. Others had an old house in Fontainebleau, with a veranda straight out of a Manet painting, and family stories that went back to Napoleonic times. Others lived near the Bastille, or in Hemingway's Montparnasse, or in the Latin Quarter--wonderfully convenient when, as a teenager, I needed to sneak into the revolutionary riots in 1968. All these places found their way into my novel.</p> <p>The son of a laborer taught me street-fighting--my background for the Gascon family. I knew an old monarchist priest who still held the French kings sacred; an aristocrat who'd known Chagall, and a virulent Marxist student. I lived with professional families whose shared memories went back to the days of the Belle Epoque and beyond. These were the sources of my characters and stories.</p> <p>And as a young man, I also fell in love in Paris, with an older woman, which left me with memories of Neuilly when the horse chestnuts are in blossom, and of walks in the Parisian dawn, and an old house with parquet floors that creaked, and the smell of fresh croissants and cafe au lait in the morning.</p> <p>But if Marcel Proust found the past brought vividly back to life by the taste of a madeleine, I too have a taste and smell to share; of eating frogs legs at the age of eight, and being sick afterwards . . . I still can't bear the smell. I'll stick to the croissants and cafe au lait!</p>Edward Rutherfurd was born in England, in the cathedral city of Salisbury. Educated locally, and at the universities of Cambridge, and Stanford, California, he worked in political research, bookselling and publishing. After numerous attempts to write books and plays, he finally abandoned his career in the book trade in 1983, and returned to his childhood home to write SARUM, a historical novel with a ten-thousand year story, set in the area around the ancient monument of Stonehenge, and Salisbury. Four years later, when Sarum was published, it became an instant international bestseller, remaining 23 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List. Since then he has written five more bestsellers: RUSSKA, a novel of Russia; LONDON; THE FOREST, set in England&#39;s New Forest which lies close by Sarum, and two novels which cover the story of Ireland from the time just before Saint Patrick to the twentieth century. In 2009 NEW YORK was published, and Edward is hard at work on another big novel at present. His books have been translated into twenty languages.</p><h2>The Marriage of Bette and Boo.

Since the end of the Cold War in 1991, the British Army has undergone deep and widespread changes, including the creation of new units and capabilities, as well as cuts and amalgamations. It has digested these changes while simultaneously fighting in two major expeditionary wars (one of them ongoing) and in several lesser overseas deployments. While small by superpower standards, it continues to "punch above its weight," and is unquestionably the most experienced (indeed, virtually the only experienced) fighting force in Europe. It remains the only NATO ally which the USA can rely on to contribute significant combat forces for expeditionary campaigns.</p></p><p>Brigadier Jim Tanner is a former infantryman who saw action (and was wounded) as a company commander with the 7th Armored Brigade in the 1991 Gulf War, and went on to serve in several other overseas postings.

The son of the 1st Baron Revelstoke (a director of the Bank of England and a senior partner at Baring Bros.) he was educated at Eton and at Cambridge, and joined the diplomatic service in 1898. In 1904 he became a journalist and reported the Russo-Japanese War in Manchuria; later he was a correspondent in Russia and Constantinople. He is credited with having discovered Chekov&#39;s work in Moscow and helping to introduce it to the West. Baring is remembered as a versatile, prolific and highly successful writer, who produced articles, plays, biographies, criticism, poetry, translations, stories and novels. He is regarded as a representative of the social culture that flourished in England before World War I, his work highly regarded to this day for the acute intimate portraits of the time.A classic autobiography.--Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</p><h2>The Opened Letter: Networking in the Early Modern British World (The Early Modern Americas)</h2><p><p>By the early eighteenth century, the rapid expansion of the British empire had created a technological problem: communication and networking became increasingly vital yet harder to maintain. As colonial possessions and populations grew and more individuals moved around the globe, Britons both at home and abroad required a constant and reliable means of communication to conduct business, plumb intellectual concerns, discuss family matters, run distant estates, and exchange news. As face-to-face communication became more intermittent, men and women across the early modern British world relied on letters.</p><p>In <i>The Opened Letter</i>, historian Lindsay O'Neill explores the importance and impact of networking via letter-writing among the members of the elite from England, Ireland, and the colonies. Combining extensive archival research with social network digital technology, <i>The Opened Letter</i> captures the dynamic associations that created a vibrant, expansive, and elaborate web of communication. The author examined more than 10,000 letters produced by such figures as Virginia planters William Byrd I and his son William Byrd II; the Anglo-Irish nobleman John Perceval; the newly minted Duke of Chandos, James Brydges, and his wife Cassandra Brydges; and Sir Hans Sloane, the president of the Royal Society, and his colleague Peter Collinson. She also mined letters from the likes of Nicholas Blundell, a Catholic member of the Lancashire gentry, and James Eliot, a London merchant and ardent Quaker. <i>The Opened Letter</i> reassembles and presents the vital individual and interlocking epistolary webs constructed by disparate groups of letter writers. These early social networks illuminate the structural, social, and geographic workings of the British world as the nation was becoming a dominant global power.</p></p><p>Lindsay O&#39;Neill teaches in the Department of History at the University of Southern California.<p>"A great book that itself opens up rich discussions of 'networking,' as well as those to do with letters, letter-writing, and news. By concentrating on the relatively understudied late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, this book marks a useful intervention, especially in debates about Atlantic integration, social cohesion, and the circulation of information."&#x2014;Sarah M.

Born in Strasbourg, he spent virtually all of his life there working as a mendicant preacher in the Order of Preachers. A product of the newly ascendant merchant class, he attempted to address its concern for a practical, active spirituality while being true to the apophatic tradition that he saw in Eckhart. If Eckhart can be called the greatest theoretician of the spiritual life in fourteenth-century Europe, then Tauler was certainly the one who most effectively interpreted Eckhart's message to a broader audience, adding a measure of balance and clarity lacking in his master. <p>Tauler's sermons were among the most influential spiritual writings of the late middle ages, esteemed in their own day by their hearers and later by both Catholics and Protestants. This translation of selected sermons by Maria Shrady captures the brilliance and perspicuity that has made Tauler famous. </p><p>Summing up his contribution, Josef Schmidt writes in his introduction to this volume: "He was preaching in the context of an everyday medieval reality which he tried to make translucent for men of good will, enabling them to return to what he perceived to be the ultimate union: the return to God."</p></p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Royal Route to Heaven and Blessings Out of Buffetings: Studies in 1 and 2 Corinthians</h2><p>In His message of salvation and sanctification, Jesus Christ summons us to a regal and yet challenging journey.

Even after he gave his life to Christ, he was still drawn to the world. He was tormented by the words &#34;Saved soul-wasted life&#34; until he cried out to the Lord, &#34;Please, come in and take over my life and be King of my heart!&#34; In 1936, Alan became an evangelist, and he spent the next three decades in the pastorate, ministering at churches in England, America, and Scotland.

You would never guess that behind the closed doors of her family&#x2019;s idyllic Long Island house hid teetering stacks of aging newspaper, broken computers, and boxes upon boxes of unused junk festering in every room&#x2014;the product of her father&#x2019;s painful and unending struggle with hoarding.</p><p>In this dazzling memoir,&nbsp;Miller brings to life her experience growing up in a rat-infested home, hiding her father&#x2019;s shameful secret from friends for years, and the emotional burden that ultimately led to her suicide attempt. In beautiful prose, Miller sheds light on her complicated yet loving relationship with her parents, which has thrived in spite of the odds.</p><p><i>Coming Clean</i> is a story about recognizing where you come from and understanding the relationships that define you.

A brilliant guy who ended up driving a bus, Miller&#x2019;s father was an extreme hoarder, and the family&#x2019;s normal-from-the-outside (at least for a while) Long Island home was a mess (or treasure trove, depending on your point of view) of useless (or fascinating) papers and junk (important stuff). In <i>Coming Clean</i>, Miller, an actor and writer, chronicles her weird childhood and adolescence, but what&#x2019;s really unusual about this buoyant, winning memoir is that for all that the author describes the familial dysfunction in heartbreaking, copious detail&#x2014;and for all that she sometimes lost patience with her parents&#x2014;she never stops showing that she loves them. As readers we come to love them, too&#x2014;partly because, whatever else, they managed to raise such a smart and witty and generous daughter. &#x2014;<i>Sara Nelson</i><p>Kimberly Rae Miller&nbsp;is a writer and actress living in New York City.

One rustic and earthen, the other the very picture of refinement, both have played a fundamental role in the expression of French culture from rural life to the high court at Versailles. This lushly photographed book takes the reader on a sun-soaked journey to the craft's ancestral home of Provence, in the South of France, to view the fascinating process of creation involved in these cherished crafts. <p>Filled with fascinating historical anecdotes, this thoroughly researched book goes inside the centuries-old ateliers of Provence to examine the making of pottery and faience from the cultivating of clay and its shaping at the potter's wheel to the kilns, painted decoration, and more. This lovely book offers not only a close-up look at this world-renowned craft but also a moving portrait of life in Provence.</p></p><p>Bernard Duplessy is an expert on the history, literature, cuisine, and architecture of Provence.

Trilogy.</em> Now this avatar of conspiriology, renowned for his razor wit and progressive philosophy, takes you on a fascinating, eclectic ride through what Wilson has termed the "Cultic Twilight" where conspiracy theories flourish. <p> <em>Everything Is Under Control</em> covers the range of Wilson's kaleidoscopic knowledge, from John Adams to the Voronezh (former Soviet Union) UFO sighting, the Campus Crusade for Cthulhu to the Mothman prophecies, and everything in between. What do the Freemasons, the Kennedys, and Princess Diana have in common? All are at the center of gigantic conspiracy theories with incredibly complex and endlessly multiplying twists, turns, highways and byways. Arranged by alphabetical entries which include cross-references to other entries in the book and also provide addresses to related sites on the Web, this book is truly interactive--you can dip in, read through, or follow one of the URLs from an interesting entry onto the internet. </p><p> What some famous people say about Robert Anton Wilson:</p><p></p><blockquote>"A dazzling barker hawking tickets to the most thrilling tilt-a-whirls and daring loop-o-planes on the midway to higher consciousness."<br>--Tom Robbins<p>"Wilson managed to reverse every mental polarity in me, as if I had been pulled through infinity."<br>--Philip K. Dick</p><p>"One of the most important scientific philosophers of his century--scholarly, witty, scientific, hip and hopeful."<br>--Dr. Timothy Leary</p></blockquote></p><p>Robert Anton Wilson is the grand pooh-bah of late-20th-century conspiracy theory, but regular Wilson fans may find <i>Everything Is Under Control</i> inchoate in comparison to such masterworks as the Illuminatus! trilogy. The format may be encyclopedic, but the information isn't; to note one glaring omission, the only entries on Ronald Reagan refer readers to three other entries in which Reagan is briefly mentioned--none of which has anything to do with Iran-Contra. (Actually, there is a listing for Iran-Contra, but again, it merely points to <i>some</i> of the pieces of the puzzle.)<p> The book's primary value, then, apart from the snippets of conspiracy "proof" it does provide, is in Wilson's playful yet insightful articulation of the psychology and linguistics of conspiratorial thinking. "Because we can say 'the Jews' or 'the New World Order' or 'the Patriarchy,'" he writes, "we can believe, or almost believe, that these grammatical abstractions have the same kind of reality as basketballs, barking dogs, and baked beans." There are also some fun private jokes, including a lot of data on the Discordians. It's not the best Wilson book--that, perhaps, is <i>Masks of the Illuminati</i>--but it's an adequate introduction to his imaginative philosophy. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Robert Anton Wilson has authored more than 30 books, teaches at Esalen, Oasis, Interface, and Open Center, maintains an award-winning website, and has been a guest artist on a punk rock record with Golden Horde.</p><h2>Pilgrims Guide to Oberammergau (Pilgrim&#39;s Guides)</h2><p>Since it was first performed in 1634, the passion play at Oberammergau has been an unforgettable experience for many millions of people.

The problem with my plans is that they never work out. I have tried wishes, too, but I gave up on that right after third grade. Here is what happened. Last summer, I was down the street at Paulie Miller&#x2019;s birthday party. First, I got in trouble because when I counted the candles on his cake, there were only nine, so I said to Mrs. Miller, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the one to grow on?&#x201d; but she didn&#x2019;t hear me, so I said it a little louder, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the one to grow on? He can&#x2019;t get to ten without it,&#x201d; and she told me to hush, so I hushed. I really did hush. So Paulie closed his eyes and made a wish (you could see it in his face), and blew out the candles. He only blew out eight, and I saw his mom blow out the last one. But still I hushed because she gave me a look.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Supposedly, your wish is a secret, but Paulie had no secrets. I knew he was going to wish for a Creepy Crawlers set, because that&#x2019;s what he told me the day before when we were talking about the party. I told him that your wish had to be a secret and that you had to wish for something good, like people not going hungry or plenty of rain right when we need it, but his face got this look, and he said, &#x201c;Well, I want Creepy Crawlers.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After we ate the cake and the ice cream (the cake was vanilla, with vanilla icing, and good; the ice cream was chocolate--yuck), everyone went outside to run around and play statues and then dodgeball, and I knew what I had to do. I went to the pile of presents and took the one that was the Creepy Crawlers set (big box, and anyway, I could see the words through the tissue paper) and I put it in the closet, under a lot of stuff. It didn&#x2019;t take me very long, and then I closed the door of the closet and went out and played with the other kids. I am really good at statues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We came in and had some jelly beans and sat down to open the presents, and Paulie got an Erector set, a baseball bat, a ball, a Frisbee, two books, and some watercolors and a pad (from me--Mom always says to give as a present what you yourself like best; I told him I would teach him how to draw a horse). But then his mom began running around, looking behind stuff and under the couch and all, and at first I didn&#x2019;t know what was going on, and then I realized that she was looking for the Creepy Crawlers, but I didn&#x2019;t say anything. And they never found it until the rains started in the fall and they had to get out their boots and raincoats. I had hidden it really well. Whenever I do something, I make my best effort, just like Mom tells me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even though I didn&#x2019;t get in trouble, I did realize that if you keep your wish a secret, you probably won&#x2019;t get it, so you have to say what you wish and then, probably, say it again and again, because that&#x2019;s the only way it works, even if it takes a long time to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every weekend and sometimes more often than that, I go to the stables and have a riding lesson. My teacher is Abby Lovitt. She is in high school, and she is a really good rider. The horse I ride every weekend is one she trained whose name is True Blue. We call him Blue. Last year, I rode a pony, but he got sold. Blue is a lot bigger, and at first I was afraid of how tall he is, but then I got on him and he was so nice, much nicer than the pony, and now I like him very much. The pony wasn&#x2019;t bad, but the pony was a lot like me. The pony was always saying, &#x201c;I will do what I want, and you can come along for the ride,&#x201d; and then he would toss his head, and lucky for me, mostly he wanted to do what I wanted him to, but not always. Blue says, &#x201c;What do you want to do? That is what I want to do, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grown-ups will tell you that horses can&#x2019;t talk. It might be that Todd Kerrigan, who is in my class and who I eat lunch with every day, is the only person in the world who thinks that the horse on TV, Mr. Ed, is actually talking. I used to watch Mr. Ed, say, two years ago, but when I started taking riding lessons, I decided that I was not interested in a horse that just stands around in a stall, moving his mouth to a voice-over. Anyway, my dad says that Mr. Ed isn&#x2019;t on TV anymore, so I guess that was why last month Todd finally stopped asking me if I had seen Mr. Ed the night before. Abby might say that horses don&#x2019;t talk, too, but she talks to the horses all the time, and why would she do that if the horses don&#x2019;t talk back to her? I mean, I&#x2019;m not talking about what everyone knows--if someone is walking toward Blue&#x2019;s stall and shouts, &#x201c;Blue, Blue! How are you?&#x201d; he will pop his head out and whinny. That makes everyone laugh, and then you are supposed to think that he is saying, &#x201c;I am fine. How are you?&#x201d; because he has very good manners. My mom talks to me about manners all the time. &#x201c;Please&#x201d; and &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; and &#x201c;How do you do? Nice to meet you,&#x201d; and shake hands and look her in the eye, and if she wants to give you a little kiss on the cheek, stand there quietly, and don&#x2019;t wipe it off, if you must, until she has turned away. (This is my aunt Louise, and Mom swears that there isn&#x2019;t a yellow cloud of perfume all around her head, but I see it and it makes me kind of dizzy. Every time I tell Mom this, she says that I am exaggerating again.) At school, of course, you are supposed to sit quietly in your seat, and raise your hand when you know the answer, and do not wave it back and forth just because you know the answer and no one else does, and no one has known the answer for the last three questions, so why does Miss Cranfield have to keep calling on them? It is a waste of time, but the more you know the answer, the less they call on you, and so how is that good manners?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, if I can possibly be quiet (and sometimes I possibly can), I sit on the fence and listen to Abby talking to Blue or Gee Whiz or one of Jane&#x2019;s horses, and she says, &#x201c;Oh, that is very good! Nice square turn, now easy up into the canter, right lead. Good boy. Four strides to the crossbar, ease back now, one two three four. Good jump. Let&#x2019;s try that again.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not saying that she talks to them all the time--you can&#x2019;t in a horse show, for one thing, and for another, all conversations stop and start. But maybe they are saying to her, &#x201c;Did you like that? What now? Which lead? Tell me the difference between right and left again . . . oh yes, I&#x2019;ve got it. One two three four, two plus two is four, this crossbar is easy as pie, let&#x2019;s try another one.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue and Gee Whiz are both grays, and both Thoroughbreds, but everything else about them is different. Blue is always looking around. He notices things, and he doesn&#x2019;t sometimes like what he notices. I would say that he is a little shy, but Jane says &#x201c;careful&#x201d; is the word. When I am riding him, I am supposed to let him take his time. He may look and make up his mind, and if we don&#x2019;t push him, he will go on and do what he is told. He is a very beautiful horse, dark mane, dark tail, and dapples along his underside and over his haunches. When he first came to the stables where I ride (he used to be Abby&#x2019;s and he lived at her place, but since my ears are very big, I know from eavesdropping that Jane bought him, also for a lot of money, but my ears are not big enough to know how much), he was very spooky, but Jane says that Abby has performed a miracle with that horse, and now he is very reliable, which is a good thing, because my mom would make me stop riding him if he acted bad. Jane runs the stables, which are big and very expensive, and surrounded by a famous golf course. Lots of people board their horses there, and they have horse shows and golf tournaments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gee Whiz is huge and very white. He used to be a racehorse and won a lot of money, but Abby didn&#x2019;t get any of it because she didn&#x2019;t own him in those days. He stares at things, and does not seem to be afraid of anything. He lives at Abby&#x2019;s ranch (Oak Valley Ranch, it is called) and only comes to the stables to school over bigger fences. If he comes on a day when I am having a lesson, I try to stay after my lesson and watch. Abby and Jane always talk about whether to go slow with him, because they don&#x2019;t want to overdo it, but I am here to tell you that the last thing on earth that Gee Whiz wants to do is to go slow. He wants to go fast and jump big jumps, and I admit that yes, he needs to learn to turn a little better. Blue is much more handy. &#x201c;Handy&#x201d; is a word that I really like. In every horse show, they have a class called Handy Hunters, where the horse has to do all kinds of things, some at the trot, some at the canter, some at the hand gallop, tight turns, halts, opening gates. When I get to jump higher than a foot and a half and go in hunter classes (maybe next year), that is what I want to do. My mom says she does not see how we will be able to afford much showing, because showing is really expensive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Abby has another horse, too, a racehorse. His name is Jack So Far, and he is down in Los Angeles. He was born on the Lovitts&#x2019; ranch, and his mom died when he was a foal. He is getting ready for his first race, which should happen in the next few weeks, according to Jane. He was training at Vista del Canada, which is a pretty nice place near here, but he went to LA after a few months, and I heard Jane ask Abby if she was going to go to the race, but even though I made my ears as big as I possibly could, I did not hear what Abby answered, so I do not know. And now I can see a shadow under the door of my room, and then there is a little creak, which means that Mom is peeking in to make sure I am asleep, and so I close my eyes and let my head sort of flop to one side, and I do those slow breaths so she will think I&#x2019;m asleep and go to bed. It is ten o&#x2019;clock; my bedtime is eight-thirty, and I have to get up at seven, so I guess I really should go to sleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We live right down from my school. If I walk, it is four minutes (Mom gave me a watch for Christmas, and I have taken very good care of it). If I run, it is two, because I have to run uphill. But sometimes, like today, when the fog is out and the sky is clear, I walk backward. Today it took ten minutes. I was looking down the hill to where the street disappears, and then I saw a few roofs of houses, and beyond that, there was the line of the ocean shading into the mountains across the bay, ending halfway up the sky, darker blue against lighter blue. I know you can&#x2019;t see dolphins or whales jumping from five blocks up, even if you are farsighted, but I looked for them anyway. I didn&#x2019;t get to school until after the first bell, and then I ran to my room, number four, down the hall to the right on the first floor. I sat down at my desk and looked out the window at a few trees. I do wish that Miss Cranfield&#x2019;s classroom were on the top floor, or even on the roof, because I would like to look over the trees and watch the ocean while the other kids are trying to figure out how to answer her questions. At least, it would be something to do. While she was taking the roll, I stared at the letters of the alphabet that run along the top of the blackboard. I can say the alphabet backward. It is easy. There are twenty-six letters in the alphabet. You tap a finger with each letter--thumb, Z; forefinger, Y; middle finger, X; ring finger, W; baby finger, V--all the way back to A. If you get there without forgetting a letter, the A is by itself. Generally, if I am going to forget a letter, it will be I. I don&#x2019;t know why that is. Also, the middle letters of the alphabet are M and N. I think there should be another letter between them--the exact middle. It would be a ch sound so you wouldn&#x2019;t have to write two letters to make one sound. These are the things I think about at school while the other kids are trying to get their work done. Sometimes my dad says that I am too smart for my own good. Also, I reminded myself that today is Friday, my favorite day of the week--tomorrow is my riding lesson, and if today is nice, tomorrow will probably be nice, too. We have had plenty of rain this spring, but I am hoping that is over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dad sells vacuum cleaners. He&#x2019;s gone from Monday to Thursday, because he has to go to people&#x2019;s houses and demonstrate the vacuum cleaners on the floors and the carpets that the people actually have. On Fridays and Saturdays, Mom works the evening shift at the department store. I don&#x2019;t have to say which one, because there is only one, and it is really big. Maybe Mom doesn&#x2019;t have to work there, but she has been working there since she was in high school, and she gets a discount, and anyway, it is the most beautiful place in town, and it is only a short walk, so why not go there? I don&#x2019;t know if she will keep working there after the baby is born, though.</p></p><h2>The Recipe Hall of Fame Cookbook II: Best of the Best : Winning Recipes from Hometown America (Quail Ridge Press Cookbook Series.)</h2><p>Every recipe gets two thumbs up! <p>Only in the Recipe Hall of Fame can you find tried-and-true, All-American recipes like these! </p><p>Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, editors Gwen McKee and Barbara Moseley have done it again!

Peter Weller&#39;s voice is dry, deep, almost harsh, and through much of the book, his tone is cutting, sardonic, even angry. That&#39;s a fitting take on the protagonist, Haller, but it&#39;s too much, and the tone would be better with some variation. Weller&#39;s voice softens when Haller interacts with others, and in some of the dialogue he brings out a rhythmic lilt that is quite engaging. While a bit uneven, by and large, Weller does this dreamlike yet dour book justice.

That's Robbie Castleman's attitude about taking her children to church. She believes that Sunday morning isn't a success if she has only managed to keep the kids quiet. And she knows there's more to church for kids than trying out their new coloring books. Children are at church for the same reason as their parents: for the privilege of worshiping God. Worship, Castleman writes, is "the most important thing you can ever train your child to do." So with infectious passion, nitty-gritty advice and a touch of humor, she shows you how to help your children (from toddlers to teenagers) enter into worship. In this expanded edition Castleman includes two new appendixes on the important issues of hyperactive children in worship and children's church for seekers. She also provides a study guide for personal reflection or group discussion. More than ever, <em>Parenting in the Pew</em> is essential reading for parents and worship leaders who want to help children make joyful noises unto the Lord.</p><p>Robbie F. Castleman (D.Min., University of Dubuque) is professor of biblical studies and theology at John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas. She previously served for several years as a staff member with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, specializing in ministry to graduate students at campuses in and around Tallahassee, Florida. She is the author of the Fisherman Bible Guides<br><br>(Shaw/Waterbrook) and the IVP Connect LifeGuide Bible Study<br><br>and she is a contributor to the book<br><br>(Knox/Westminster)."Compelling reading. . . . Filled with good ideas, straightforward challenges, and true-to-life examples. It's a passionate call to spiritual parenting that reminds adults to actively participate in church services themselves while leading little ones into God's presence." (Bookstore Journal)<br><br>"Robbie Castleman does wonders in this book! She actually does show how 'training children to pay attention to God . . . is one rare way to have your cake and eat it too.' Her biblically grounded theology and experientially tested practical ideas give us wonderful suggestions that deepen our own participation in worship, even while we help children truly worship instead of merely keeping quiet. This book is essential--for pastors, Sunday school teachers, youth leaders, parents and every other member of the congregation (since we all are responsible for forming the church's offspring). The Christian community could be changed by this book; read it avidly and give it to everyone you know." (Marva J. Dawn, author of Is It a Lost Cause? and Reaching Out Without Dumbing Down)</p><h2>Charles F. Lummis: Editor of the Southwest (The Huntington Library Classics)</h2><p>Charles F. Lummis (1859 -1928) was a colorful, dynamic, and often eccentric crusader for the Spanish heritage of California. The founder and editor of <i>Land of Sunshine</i> or <i>Out West,</i> as the magazine was known after 1902 he recruited writers such as Mary Austin, Jack London, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman to contribute short stories, poetry, articles, and essays, many of them based on Western themes. Lummis himself wrote editorials extolling the glories of Southern California, decrying racial prejudice, and calling for the preservation of California&#x2019;s historic landmarks.<br><br>Bingham examines <i>Out West</i> from a number of angles: as a Western business enterprise, as a promotional vehicle, as an outlet and training ground for regional writers, and as an instrument of reform.

Often cited as a favorite of the English and American Puritans who came after him, he nevertheless stood as a bridge between the crown and the nonconformists. Jonathan D. Moore retrieves Preston from his traditional place as one of the "Calvinists against Calvin," provides a convincing argument for Preston's unique hypothetical universalism, and calls into question common misperceptions about Reformed theology and Puritanism.<br></p><p>Jonathan D Moore holds a PhD in Historical Theology from Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge. This is his first book.<b>Eamon Duffy</b><br> &#x2014; University of Cambridge<br> "Historians of Stuart England have only recently come to grasp the centrality of the intricate controversies of Reformed theologians about sin and grace, divine sovereignty and human freedom, for the interaction of religion and society, and even for the alignments of local and national politics. Jonathan Moore's learned, subtle, and incisive exploration of the thought of one of the shapers of Protestant thought in the England of James VI and Charles I brings a new sophistication to the analysis of the place of theology in the intellectual history of early Stuart England. Fascinating in its own right as a study in the varieties of English Calvinism, his study is also an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the theological tensions that provide the context for the English Civil War."&nbsp;<b>Anthony Milton</b><br> &#x2014; University of Sheffield<br> "This subtle, shrewd, and learned study of a vitally important topic offers an important corrective to existing work on the period. Jonathan Moore makes a compelling case for John Preston's hypothetical universalism, and in the process provides a completely new slant not just on the York House Conference but on the whole Arminian dispute that rocked the Church of England in the 1620s. This sophisticated study should be required reading for anyone working on religious thought in the early Stuart period."&nbsp;<b>Alan Ford</b><br> &#x2014; University of Nottingham<br> "Essential reading for anyone interested in seventeenth-century religion. Clear, confident, and convincing, Jonathan Moore not only transforms our knowledge of John Preston but also reshapes the way in which we view the development of early modern Calvinist theology."</p><h2>Angel Kisses: Little Touches of Heaven</h2><p><p>Sandra Kuck's award-winning paintings of angelic children and lavish floral borders breathe charm and innocence into our daily life.

In the early hours of the following morning, Merrily Watkins and her daughter Jane are made aware that Aidan Lloyd, son of a wealthy farmer, will not be resting in peace. A rural tradition is displaying its sinister side as an old feud re-ignites. It&#39;s already a fraught time for Merrily, her future threatened by a bishop committed to restricting her role as deliverance consultant, or diocesan exorcist. Suddenly there are events she can&#39;t talk about as she and Jane find themselves potentially on the wrong side of the law. Meanwhile, DI Frannie Bliss, investigating a shooting, must confront the growth organized crime which is contaminating the countryside. On the Welsh border, the old ways are at war with the modern world. As the days shorten and the fog gives way to ice and snow, Merrily Watkins is drawn into a conflict centered on one of Britain&#39;s most famous medieval churches, its walls laden with ancient symbolism.</p><p><b>Phil Rickman</b> is the author of the Merrily Watkins series and the John Dee series.

But, today, we have become sceptical about the ability of an individual philosopher to engage in &#x2018;universal thinking&#x2019;, so philosophy seems to capitulate in the face of cultural relativism.<br><br>In <i>Introduction to Antiphilosophy</i>, Boris Groys argues that modern &#x2018;antiphilosophy&#x2019; does not pursue the universality of thought as its goal but proposes in its place the universality of life, material forces, social practices, passions, and experiences &#x2013; angst, vitality, ecstasy, the gift, revolution, laughter or &#x2018;profane illumination&#x2019; &#x2013; and he analyses this shift from thought to life and action in the work of thinkers from Kierkegaard to Derrida, from Nietzsche to Benjamin.<br><br>Ranging across the history of modern thought, <i>Introduction to Antiphilosophy</i> endeavours to liberate philosophy from the stereotypes that hinder its development.</p><p><b>Boris Groys</b> is Professor of Aesthetics, Art History, and Media Theory at the Center for Art and Media Technology in Karlsruhe, and since 2005, the Global Distinguished Professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science, NYU.

By reading every one of the few books then available, by practising, experimenting and persevering, he slowly improved his skills. David and his wife Christine successfully ran the British College of Lace, providing lacemaking courses and producing videos and books. They became experts in the identification and classification of nineteenth-century East Midland lace bobbins and their makers. The results of their research provided the basis for their book Success to the Lace Pillow, which is used by auction houses as the authority on this subject. At the end of a working day, spent turning highly decorated lace bobbins in the traditional English style, David would allow himself the relaxation of experimental turning. From this developed his fascination with the apparently impossible and somewhat improbable in turned wood. This led him to the discoveries featured in this book, and in his equally intriguing Adventures in Woodturning. He is on the Register of Professional Turners maintained by the Worshipful Company of Turners of London.

Arthur Walkington Pink (1886-1952) was an English Christian evangelist and Biblical scholar known for his staunchly Calvinist and Puritan-like teachings. After Pink&#39;s death, his works were republished by a number of publishing houses and reached a much wider audience as a result. Biographer Iain Murray observes of Pink, &#34;the widespread circulation of his writings after his death made him one of the most influential evangelical authors in the second half of the twentieth century.&#34; His writing sparked a revival of expository preaching and focused readers&#39; hearts on biblical living.</p><p>A Transforming Knowledge of the Living God<br><br>The timeless appeal of this classic book, written by a preacher with a worldwide ministry during the first half of the twentieth century, demonstrates the deep hunger for a saving knowledge of God present in each generation. Arthur Pink sought to give readers not just a theoretical knowledge of God but pointed them toward a personal relationship of yielding to him and living according to his biblical precepts. <br><br>Pink's book explores attributes such as God's decrees, foreknowledge, sovereignty, holiness, grace, and mercy, among many others, all packaged in a style especially useful for pastors, teachers, and Bible students. Our God who is above all names cannot be found through human searching alone, Pink teaches, but can be known only as he is revealed by the Holy Spirit through his living Word.<br>Arthur W.

Introduced by &#x201c;poetry DJ&#x201d; Catherine Bowman, these popular short segments allowed listeners to experience poetry as a kind of verbal music, recalling its roots as a spoken art form. <b>Word of Mouth</b>, edited by Bowman, brings together the poems that have been featured on NPR, providing a window onto the dynamic contemporary poetry scene. A child playing with flashes of sunlight in the aisle of an airplane; a woman describing tropical fruit to someone in a faraway country; a man building a deck with his dead father&#x2019;s hammer; the musings of a Barbie doll participating in a 12-step program: these poems powerfully and lyrically transform the stuff of every day life. A celebration of the poetic voice that includes 33 acclaimed writers, this vibrant anthology proves beyond any doubt that poetry is far more than just words on paper.<br><br>Quincy Troupe ï¿½ Czeslaw Milosz ï¿½ Campbell McGrath ï¿½ C.D.

She regularly collaborates with composer and bassist John Lindberg; together they have performed and taught workshops at a variety of venues in both North America and Europe.What is a poem? People often ask me that, and I always feel that it&#x2019;s one of those easy questions that&#x2019;s impossible to answer, like trying to define or dissect a kiss. Donald Hall calls a poem a deliciousness of the senses. Emily Dickinson wrote in a letter: &#x201c;If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.&#x201d; William Carlos Williams believed a poem was a little machine made out of words. Laura Howard, a young poet in one of my classes, called a poem a brand-new pair of red go-go boots. Here&#x2019;s Coleridge&#x2019;s famous definition of poetic imagination: &#x201c;a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I Am.&#x201d; Robert Frost said poetry is a wild tune, a necessary stay against con-fusion. But definition and denotation are the enemies of poetry; one can only reach an approximation, for it&#x2019;s like trying to pin down what is con-stantly moving, shifting, vital, protean&#x2014;<br><br> Over the years, introducing poets to a wide audience on National Public Radio (NPR), I discovered that what is most interesting about poetry right now in America is the remarkable polyphonic medley of voices and audiences. I wasn&#x2019;t interested in reporting or touting the pickings from particular literary trends, the academic marketplace, or certain aesthetic schools. To declare the three or four top voices that will live on didn&#x2019;t seem pertinent to the task at hand, nor did it accurately convey what is going on in the country. Instead, as a practitioner and lover of poetry, I wanted to offer a wide range of voices showing how varied the imagination can be, how complex and full of possibility. That is to say, the poems in this book are not composed around a commonly agreed middle C. Instead, these poems&#x2014;sometimes tuneful, sometimes hymnal, other times rau-cous and scraping&#x2014;harmonize on the racket and cacophony of our times in an admixture of seduction, heartbreak, consolation, and wisdom. In the marvelous way they attend to the world, these poems make a love-music that undermines generalizations and presuppositions about poetry and about the voices behind the poems. For example, the most passionate and profound love poems in the collection are by poets over the age of sixty. If anything, considering the contents of this book, a poem could be defined as a conversation. Muriel Rukeyser called poetry &#x201c;a meeting place.&#x201d; A meeting place where conversations can take place between the poem and the reader; between imaginations, identities, landscapes, bor-ders, and boundaries; between the world of personal experience, such as dreams and private perceptions, and the world of data-based historically recorded fact; a conversation on life and its irrevocable choices. Rukeyser says, &#x201c;A poem invites you to feel. More than that: it invites you to respond. And better than that: a poem invites total response. Poetry asks us to feel and it asks us to respond.&#x201d; This is a conversation full of wonder and nourishment, and you are invited to engage with the questions and answers grafted between the lines and images. Listening to or reading a poem is an invitation for both poem and reader to engage in what Octavio Paz calls &#x201c;two moments of a single reality.&#x201d; <br><br>Often this conversation is uneasy, asks tough questions. Many of the writers included here have lived through hardships, abuse, poverty, ill-ness, and the devastation of racism and war; yet in spite of their grappling with life&#x2019;s pain, we also hear the rocking solace of a lullaby: the poet transcending sorrow through the music of language&#x2014;through song.<br><br>Former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky has said, &#x201c;Poetry is a vocal, which is to say a bodily art. The medium of poetry is a human body: the column of air inside the chest, shaped into signifying sounds in the larynx and the mouth. In this sense, poetry is just as physical or bodily an art as dancing.&#x201d; Listeners of NPR have told me over and over that hearing poems read out loud offered a way into poetry they had not discovered through simply reading; they discovered new ways to experience the poem. To take the poem off the page and into the airwaves gives us a way to participate in the physicality of the poem. There is, I believe, a return to poetry&#x2019;s earlier origins and roots in the spoken word, as it attempts to resist the mind/body split that typifies so much of our lives and public discourse. The voice mediated through the telephone, the microphone, the radio, the tape recorder, the webstream, and other sound technologies; the modernists&#x2019; and post&#x2013;World War II poets&#x2019; impulse to create a poetry based on the rhythms of American speech; and a desire to return to so-called primitive poetry of spoken ritual and spirituality: all these point to a growing emphasis on the oral nature of poetry. Eliot&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Waste Land&#x201d; was originally titled &#x201c;He Do the Police in Different Voices.&#x201d; Langston Hughes created a literary verse form out of the blues. The spoken, oral aspects of poetry were essential to the work of such poets as Frank O&#x2019;Hara, Denise Levertov, Ricardo Sanchez, Charles Olson, Amiri Baraka, and Alan Ginsberg with their emphasis on talking, breath, folk forms, organic physical structures, and musical vocalizations. Ginsberg and Robert Creeley said the inspiration for their poetic line came not from iambic pentameter but from listening to bebop. Jayne Cortez, Sonia Sanchez, and Quincy Troupe often collaborate and perform with musicians and composers. In this sense, NPR has done something quite radical and avant-garde by following the lead of the poets and allowing us to experience the poem off the page in a way that is both rhythm-based and meaning-based. For in poetry, rhythm is the highest form of meaning. In an essay called &#x201c;Poetry &amp; the Microphone,&#x201d; George Orwell says, &#x201c;if true poetry could be introduced to the big public in such a way as to make it seem normal ...then part of the prejudice against it might be overcome.&#x201d; <br><br>In the spring of 1995, NPR&#x2019;s All Things Considered ï¿½ invited me to be their on-the-air &#x201c;poet-reporter&#x201d; for an ongoing series on contemporary poetry. This book is a collection of the poems and poets we have show-cased since 1995. (Some of the poems that we recorded but could not air because of time restraints are also included here.) In these five- to ten-minute segments, broadcast to an audience of over eight million world-wide, NPR listeners would usually hear three or four poems recorded by the author in the studio. My job was to act as a kind of Poetry DJ, introducing the poems and poet, and then commenting in a chat-style format, usually with All Things Considered hosts Linda Wertheimer and Noah Adams. The poetry showcase not only quickly and inexpensively featured a whole array of poets, but also talked about poetry in a casual, nonacademic manner, offering people not only poems to listen to, but also a model in which to talk about poetry without being pretentious and rarified, keeping it conversational.<br><br>I first started thinking about this project when I was living on a ranch in the Texas Hill Country and working on a new book of poems. Most evenings, I would sit on the front porch meditating on the limestone and granite cliffs, mottled with live oak and the gnarly cedar. Colossal longhorn steer, souvenirs from the old west, would wander like clockwork through the yard from the next-door ranch. I listened to the radio a lot, and I started wondering why I never heard any poetry on the radio. Looking up at the big Texas sky, I remembered many years as a kid with the transistor radio up to my ear listening to late-night FM as I imagined the world and all of its animals asleep. This is the same feeling of reverie I have when reading poetry, a feeling of transcending time and space into various other worlds and frequencies. Most of all, poetry, with its great compression and linguistic music, seemed just right for the radio. Real poetry was being written and read more than ever before, but why the invisibility in the mainstream media? My suspicion was that it had more to do with marketing and exposure and the current critical discourse around poetry, than with poetry&#x2019;s decline as a cultural force in people&#x2019;s lives. <br><br>My home at the time was in New York City, where I had been working as a poet-in-the-schools with Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative. An itinerant poetry lady, I traveled all over New York City, from elementary schools in the South Bronx to the High School for Pregnant and Parenting Teens in East New York, and during these residencies I had observed the absolute pleasure and joy young people found in reading and writing poetry. I also loved going to poetry readings. There was an exciting scene burgeoning downtown. On any given Friday night, at the Nuyorican Poets Cafï¿½, Miguel Algarï¿½n and Bob Holman would introduce the packed room to exciting new voices&#x2014;bringing poetry off the page, onto the stage&#x2014;challenging notions about where poetry comes from, who has access to it, who writes, it and who reads it. Uptown, there were the more established but equally exciting readings sponsored by the Academy of American Poets or the Ninety-second Street Y. These series, plus many others, both uptown and downtown, came out of the work of poets and arts activists like Paul Blackburn and Elizabeth Cray, who early on understood the significance of reading poetry out loud and recording it. Currently, on any given night there are poetry readings and open mics in cities all over the country. Perhaps this resurgence and interest in the spoken word is bigger than poetry. Maybe it has to do with a human need, a real hunger for a genuine physical experience of language itself. <br><br>When I returned to New York from Texas, my husband, Andy Biskin, helped me make a cassette tape of five poets reading their poems along with very brief recorded introductions. One of the poets was the late Joseph Brodsky, whom we recorded on my Walkman one afternoon at our dining room table over coffee. My idea was simply to showcase the poems, to hear the poet reading his or her work. When I sent the tape in to NPR I was acting as an advocate of poetry more than anything else. A few days later All Things Considered producer Margaret Low Smith called saying they liked my ideas but wanted one small change: they wanted me to introduce the poets and talk a little about the poems. It turned out they had been wanting to get poetry on the air for a while, and they saw my recordings as a way to do it. <br><br>William Carlos Williams said, &#x201c;If it ain&#x2019;t a pleasure, it ain&#x2019;t a poem.&#x201d; I try to keep his words in mind when I introduce poems; the idea is to open doors, not give reading instructions&#x2014;to show just how pleasurable hearing and reading poems can be. The poems are often short, often accessible, showing that accessibility can be emotionally and intellectually complex. That poetry doesn&#x2019;t have to wear priestly robes, speak in puzzles, smell like a rare and perfect rose, and float in the realm of ideas instead of walking firmly on the ground. The poetry showcase has been extraordinarily popular for listeners. Letters and e-mails have come in from all over the world, some with questions and comments, some to applaud, some to heckle, others to critique and complain, most wanting to know where they could get the book. One man wrote from a maximum security prison, sending along a small religious medallion. Don&#x2019;t send it back, he said, it won&#x2019;t get through the metal detector. I loved the thought that poetry on the radio could get past metal detectors and into maximum security prisons. <br><br>It&#x2019;s a paradox, because when you listen to a poem on the radio you may be chopping tomatoes at home, driving the afternoon car pool, or typing at the office, and it feels as if the poet is speaking directly to you, even though millions of people are listening to the poem at the same time. It&#x2019;s a way to experience and interact with the poem in a very personal way, providing an intimacy that is both communal and private.<br><br> Likewise, the poet is sitting alone in a glassed-in sound studio; his or her voice is digitized, and then miraculously reassembled through a fiber-optic cable and sent into the homes, workplaces, and car stereos of millions. These poems offer a series of private, individual voices speaking out in the public sphere, an alternative to the numbing, all too familiar language of public discourse, newspeak, and advertising. Historically, rather than an instrument to channel and transmit possibilities for love, trust, and peace, the radio has often been and continues to be a vehicle for the apostles of hate and fear, fundamentalism, fanaticism, racism, and other ideologies of intolerance. The sound of the voice, over the airwaves, in sermon and in song, as well as in poetry, has a commanding effect on the human psyche. The ear is an opening with a direct line to the brain and the heart. Unlike the mouth and the eyes, it never closes. <br><br>While the radio is often used as a tool to propagate a false unified majority, it can also be a way to show both community and difference within community. We&#x2019;re not used to hearing private voices speaking on private experiences over the air, in the public sphere. When poems are sandwiched in between news and the telling of world events, they are themselves news. Poems are either praise-songs or laments. The poems collected here lean more toward the former, a natural counterpoint to the news of lament: floods, war, business fraud, and political shenanigans that fill the airwaves. The poems often speak to what Paul Muldoon calls &#x201c;the conditions of joy,&#x201d; a condition much underrepresented in the news and, it could be argued, in contemporary poetry. Often the poems are very funny, breaking down stereotypes that poetry has to be anguished and self-absorbed. Several poems look at the same experience from different angles and perspectives: for example, there are two poems that deal with the wisdom offered by a child to passengers on a jumbo jet flight. There are several poems about birth and several birthday poems; more than one poem takes place in a garden or graveyard; there are several praise poems to the body. There are poems about work, play, music, love, lovemaking, beginnings, endings, family, eating, drinking, gardening, shopping, spirituality, sports, legacies, naming, aging, politics, art, culture, city life, country life, travel, history. There are songs, odes, sonnets, instructions, litanies, prayers, lullabies, tributes, diatribes, blues, catalogues, praise-songs, and laments. All of the poems are marked by a deep attention to the world, be it attention to memory, music, emotion, or thought. They each have a pulse, a unique physical and spiritual presence, located in the school of the five senses, comfortable more with questions than answers, finding meaning in gaps, remnants, and silences as they traverse ad infinitum the commonplace, the other unnamable place, and that mysterious place in between. <br><br>In his great poem &#x201c;Leaves of Grass,&#x201d; Walt Whitman writes about America&#x2019;s &#x201c;Athletic Democracy,&#x201d; a democracy fueled by a deft, precise, agile imagination, with the ability to shift, spin, leap; to contain contradictions and multitudes. A democracy in which Whitman warned us to resist much, obey little. A democracy that is not based on conformity, but rather on unity through acknowledgment and celebration of difference. This ideal is at the heart of this c...</p><h2>The Medieval Reader</h2><p>Letters, essays, state and church documents, poetry, ballads, and illustrations provide firsthand accounts of the life and culture of Europe from the fourth to the sixteenth centuries</p><p><p>Norman F.

She became interested in career reinventions when she left the practice of law to become a freelance journalist. Marci is now a regular contributor to the <i>New York Times</i>, a sought-after speaker, and a coach to aspiring writers and professionals in transition.For those already slashing through multifaceted professional lives, Alboher's collection of profiles of people juggling multiple roles may offer the comfort of knowing others are doing the same. For those recently separated from a job or seeking greater fulfillment from life, Alboher's fascination with people working through dual existences may reveal an alternate path to success. Like the psychotherapist/violin maker she interviews, Alboher has abandoned an easily described career as an attorney to become a journalist, author, speaker and writing coach. Her book is less about making career changes than changing how one defines a career and making adjustments for a more satisfying life. After focusing a bit too intently on how multilayered careers get their start, she segues into more action-oriented advice, including experimenting with different identities before making career-altering changes; how to keep income flowing; and how to market oneself once one adds a slash or two to one's job description. When the disparate threads of one's life are woven together in this way, she argues in this creative and satisfying guide, "the whole of you comes out." <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Roger makes a name for himself in the company known as the Death&#x2019;s Heads, and he falls in love under the most improbable circumstances. But as the months pass, and he watches the mightiest fighting force in the history of Christendom being destroyed by battle and disease and starvation, he suffers a soul-shattering crisis of faith, wondering how God could permit His children to indulge in such madness.</p><p></p><h2>The First 48 Hours: Spiritual Caregivers as First Responders</h2><p>The first 48 hours are critical to the recovery of trauma victims.<br><br>First responders make the difference between life and death for trauma victims.

Roger Scruton challenges those who would regard themselves as conservatives, and also their opponents. Conservatism, he argues, has little in common with liberalism, and is only tenuously related to the market economy, to monetarism, to free enterprise, or to capitalism. It involves neither hostility toward the state, nor the desire to limit the state&#39;s obligation toward the citizen. Its conceptions of society, law, and citizenship regard the individual not as the premise but as the conclusion of politics. At the same time it is fundamentally opposed to the ethic of social justice, to equality of station, opportunity, income, and achievement, and to the attempt to bring major institutions of society - such as schools and universities - under government control.</p><p><p>Author of dozens of books on politics, philosophy (especially aesthetics), and history, Roger Scruton is one of the premier public intellectuals Britain has produced in the past 30 years.</p><p>'...a marvellously lucid writer.' - Seamus Perry, Politics</p></p><h2>Introduction to Sociological Theory: Theorists, Concepts, and their Applicability to the Twenty-First Century</h2><p><p><b>The revised third edition of the text that combines classical and contemporary theories of sociological theory</b></p> <p>Thoroughly revised and updated, the third edition of an <i>Introduction to Sociological Theory</i> offers an in-depth introduction to classical and contemporary theories, and demonstrates their relevance to offer a clear understanding of a broad range of contemporary issues and topics.

In this book the cultural theorist Byung-Chul Han develops a fresh and original perspective on the nature of power, shedding new light on this key feature of social and political life.<br><br> Power is commonly defined as a causal relation: an individual&#x2019;s power is the cause that produces a change of behaviour in someone else against the latter&#x2019;s will. Han rejects this view, arguing that power is better understood as a mediation between <i>ego</i>&nbsp;and <i>alter</i>&nbsp;which creates a complex array of reciprocal interdependencies. Power can also be exercised not only against the other but also within and through the other, and this involves a much higher degree of mediation. This perspective enables us to see that power and freedom are not opposed to one another but are manifestations of the same power, differing only in the degree of mediation. <br><br>This highly original account of power will be of great interest to students and scholars of philosophy and of social, political and cultural theory, as well as to anyone seeking to understand the many ways in which power shapes our lives today.</p><p><b>Byung-Chul Han</b> is a Korean-born Professor of Philosophy and Cultural Studies who teaches at the University of the Arts (UdK) in Berlin. He is the author of more than 20 books including <i>The Transparency Society</i> and <i>The Burnout Society.</i>"On an itinerary driven by unusual intellectual independence and perfect argumentative transparency, Byung-Chul Han may have reached the level of true philosophical mastership. Based on a circumspect discussion of the positions marked by some classical thinkers of modernity,&nbsp;<i>What is Power?</i>&nbsp;develops a new vision of the asymmetries produced by human interaction and thus lives up to the promise to 'deprive power of that power it has on account of the fact that we do not fully understand what it actually is.'"<br><b>Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, Stanford University</b><br><br>&#x201c;The new star of German philosophy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<i><b>El Paï¿½s<br><br></b></i> <p>"It&#x2019;s no exaggeration to say that Han is one of the most relevant philosophers of our age, able to make diagnoses when other philosophers, particularly knee-jerk Foucauldian social critics in America, have trouble even seeing an illness. What is Power? is an important document of a philosopher still developing, still growing, though it&#x2019;s nevertheless interesting in its own right.

To meet these challenges, ELLs need immediate feedback about how the development of their language abilities interacts with their academic performance; and teachers need practical strategies to help ELLs develop the specific content and language abilities necessary for success. In <em>Formative Language Assessment for English Learners, </em>the research team of Rita MacDonald, Timothy Boals, Mariana Castro, H. Gary Cook, Todd Lundberg, and Paula A. White demonstrates what good language assessment for formative purposes is, explains the cycle of formative language assessment, and shows how it unfolds stage by stage in a school setting. Based on a five-year collaborative project with middle and high school teachers in three major school districts, the book presents a process for:</p> <ul> <li>Weaving a language focus into content lessons</li> <li>Analyzing students' language from writing samples to help them broaden their linguistic choices</li> <li>Creating active partnerships with students as they learn and practice new ways to use English.</li> </ul> <p>When classrooms are defined by effective language assessment for formative purposes, they become dynamic spaces in which teachers can use that information to plan clear, attainable steps to increase student learning, and students develop deeper understandings of both academic content and academic language.<em> Formative Language Assessment for English Learners </em>provides practical strategies to implement a unique process for formative assessment that can truly change classroom practice.</p> <p>This team of authors works together at the Wisconsin Center for Education Research (WCER) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and have collaborated on formative language assessment for English Language Learners through their work for WIDA (World-Class Instructional Design and Assessment), a 36-state consortium that supports academic language development for linguistically diverse students through standards, assessment, research, and professional development.</p></p><p><p>WIDA (World-Class Instructional Design and Assessment) researcher Rita MacDonald works in the field of content-language integration, using the theory and pedagogy of systemic functional linguistics to build awareness of discipline-specific language and instructional capacity for K-12 teachers.</p> <p>As Executive Director of WIDA (World-Class Instructional Design and Assessment), Dr. Timothy Boals' research interests involve the interplay between content and language learning for ELLs across the language acquisition continuum and the effects of standards on classroom practice for these learners.</p> <p>As Director of Academic Language and Literacy Initiatives at WIDA (World-Class Instructional Design and Assessment), Mariana Castro directs research and development related to the language development of PreK and school-aged children to create standards and standards-based resources for them, their families and their educators.</p> <p>Dr. H.

Along with three friends, Flinn vows to help Captain Stubble retake the <i>Acorn</i>. The closet wall falls away, revealing a bright blue day and a scrappy-looking vessel. The children don pirate garb and Captain Stubble, who prefers to be the cook, puts Flinn in charge.

This preoccupation with the afterlife, occult forces and unearthly beings existing outside the natural world led to early witch trials, stories about saintly apparitions and strange encounters with spirits and haunted places. New Mexican author Ray John de Aragï¿½n explores the time-honored tradition of frightening folklore in the Land of Enchantment in this intriguing collection of tales that crosses cultures in the dark corners of the southwestern night.</p><p>Ray John de Aragï¿½n was born in Las Vegas, New Mexico. His great-grandmother Dona Catalina Mondragon de Valdez, who was a curandera, a medicine woman, delivered him. He grew up with the culture, traditions, heritage and the history of Spanish New Mexico, which dates back to the settlement of the territory by Spanish colonists in 1598. He is an internationally recognized author with several published books. He is also a recognized visual artist and santero, a maker of religious images.</p><h2>Busy Bugs: A Book About Patterns (Penguin Young Readers, Level 2)</h2><p>The silly bugs are having a party.

Its beautiful fire lit up the express lane on a humid night, the deadly cacophony forty yards behind me on I-95. The energy from that blast rolled through me, rattled both sides of the interstate and adjacent roads like we were in a San Francisco earthquake. Brake lights came alive in an abrupt chorus. Behind me, beyond that fiery limousine, four lanes of interstate crowded with cars, trucks, and motorcycles screeched to a halt, too late for speed demons to swerve and avoid flying debris.</p> <p>I kept going.</p> <p>The target was dead. The impossible mission was completed in less than forty-eight hours.</p> <p>The corrupt and elusive con man inside the limo had been living a life of caviar and champagne, bodyguards at his side, men who were paid well and trained to shoot to kill. He was a man who didn't hesitate to take his enemies to the swamps and feed them to the gators.</p> <p>A grifter named Arizona had been one of his problems.</p> <p>And the man named Hopkins had become one of hers.</p> <p>All I knew was what she had told me. And that wasn't much. The less the better.</p> <p>What mattered was that deadly situation had been rectified.</p> <p>The remote trigger that had caused that blast was inside my gloved hand. I dropped it, pressed down on the throttle, hit the century mark, moved from right lane to left lane to right lane, threaded traffic like a needle, became a fast-ï¿½ moving shadow vanishing down I-95.</p> <p>In this gritty world, people called me Gideon. A biblical name made famous by an adjudicator in the Book of Judges. That Gideon was also known as Jerub-Baal. Destroyer. Mighty Warrior. I was Gideon. Not sent by God. Employed by those who thought they were.</p> <p>I was a hired gun paid to do what people wouldn't do for themselves.</p> <p>This has been my vocation since I was seven years old. Since I aimed a gun at an angry man they called Midnight. I had killed that man before I had been given the truth about what he was.</p> <p>Since that day, I'd been on the run, reared in brothels, lived in red light districts, had been taken into a world of retribution and learned more than two dozen ways to end a life, all for a price.</p> <p>Using a block of C-4 and a remote control wasn't even high on the goddamn list.</p> <p>Late evening, the darkness of my bike and clothing mixed with the cruelty in the night.</p> <p>I accelerated and felt like I was moving faster than the speed of sound, then slowed when I caught up and mixed with the next wave of fast-moving traffic on I-95, became a law-abiding commuter as I signaled and faded onto the next exit, took the streets, rode toward the causeways, breezed through city traffic, engine rumbling, balmy night air on my skin. Gun inside my messenger bag. Riding a Streetfighter. Trellis frame. Huge fork clamps. Solid performance. I sped toward the area called Aventura, hurried to meet my sponsor.</p> <p>The international grifter named Arizona had arrived in the U.S. and was somewhere down here in Florida. The Hopkins job was done, but now I needed her assistance, had to work out my own problems. Problems that could have me sleeping six feet under.</p> <p>Four days ago, after vanishing for almost a year, Arizona had resurfaced and sent a message. A job offer. The message had been a cryptic text, had come from an untraceable phone and was delivered to a temporary account on Gmail, one of a dozen we had set up for communicating. That particular account hadn't been used since I'd seen her in London. I'd gone to the Apple store in Minnesota's Mall of America, the country's largest retail and entertainment complex. If the IP addresses were traced, it would lead to that store. I blended with the Mac heads wore a baseball cap and shades, my face always down and away from the cameras.</p> <p>I logged on to a laptop and checked my messages.</p> <p>That con woman had sent me an encrypted message that gave me a location on the edges of Miami. Encryptions. Countersurveillance. Rendezvous points. Wire transfers.</p> <p>It was the language and lifestyle of killers and cons.</p> <p>Within the next few hours, I was on a flight heading to the land of gators.</p> <p>When I had landed in Fort Lauderdale, Arizona had arranged what I needed. Ducati Streetfighter, black motorcycle helmet, racing gloves. All that and a messenger bag that was weighed down by a nine, two extra clips, a remote, and something that would blow my target's mind.</p> <p>I took a deep breath, pulled up my face shield, and cruised.</p> <p>Starbucks was on the corner of Biscayne Boulevard and Concourse Circle Drive. Inside a plaza dotted with palm trees and filled with BMWs, Hummers, Bentleys, and Benzes. This section of South Miami looked like a dealership for new and preowned luxury cars.</p> <p>The competition of capitalism continued despite the economic downturn.</p> <p>I circled the well-lit strip mall twice before I paused on that prime chunk of real estate.</p> <p>It was a parking lot that covered all the blood that had soaked into the soil. Over a century ago, the Seminoles and the U.S. fought over this land, a bloody war that might have been the deadliest and costliest of the Indian wars, from the point of view of the U.S. of A.</p> <p>The sound of gunfire and cannon booms had been replaced with the hum of cappuccino machines and the purr of extravagant automobiles. The scent of war was now the aroma of the perfect latte.</p> <p>As soon as I headed inside, my cellular vibrated. It was a text message: FUNDS TRANSFERRED.</p> <p>I deleted that message and moved on, looked out at a warm night that thieving man thought he would live to see. But someone with anger in their heart and money in their pockets had other plans.</p> <p>Inside was like Antarctica, the AC blowing on high. The noise level was in the red, a dozen multilingual conversations being trapped by glass and walls. Cubans had conversations about one Castro in their homeland being replaced by another Castro, argued that the free health care and free education wasn't enough to make them remain a Fidelista and things needed to change in a land where Cubans couldn't own cell phones legally and computers were prohibited; the Cubans sipped five-dollar coffees and argued over the need to defender el socialismo. Next to them, groups of elderly Jewish men discussed a meeting for Holocaust survivors. Add to that chatter the nonstop whirr of the machines making lattes and cappuccinos, the din of jazz being piped in, people yapping on cellular phones, others tapping on laptops, listening to music or videos sans headphones.</p> <p>Hairs stood up on my neck. Like in London. It felt like I was being watched.</p> <p>I went into the bathroom, had to. Outside I was cool. But anxiety clung to me, shook me like a winter's chill. For a moment it felt like I was about to lose control. Another daymare. I'd had a few since Antigua. Images that attacked me while I was wide awake. I saw the dead. Faces I'd been paid to put in the ground. And I saw the faces of those who had tried to do the same to me. Standing behind them all, in the shadows, his face unclear but his silhouette unforgettable, was the man I had killed when I was seven. He was nothing more than a shadow.</p> <p>The mercenary they called Midnight. The first man I had killed. My father.</p> <p>My life was a haunted house filled with many ghosts.</p> <p>Somebody tapped on the door and I pulled the nine-millimeter out of my backpack. I called out that the bathroom was occupied. Paused. Whoever was out there walked away. The police wouldn't leave. Neither would the FBI. Both would announce they had come for me.</p> <p>I took out my iPhone. Dialed a number in Powder Springs.</p> <p>I wanted to check up on Catherine and the boys, Steven and Robert. Catherine was the woman who had raised me. Robert's mother had been killed because of my vocation. Steven was the boy Catherine called her son. But I knew that was a lie. Everything had been a lie.</p> <p>No one answered, but the answering machine kicked on.</p> <p>I didn't leave a message. I blocked my number and never left messages, not there.</p> <p>I splashed water on my face, wiped my skin down with a paper towel, and went outside.</p> <p>The hunter had been hunted before, more than once.</p> <p>I spied the room. Cubans sipping cappuccino. Jewish women doing the same. A teenaged guy wearing Dockers and black sandals was eyeing the olive complexion of a blond woman seated at the next table, her pink button-down shirt and ripped jeans not enough to mask a body that could lure most men straight to the gates of Hell.</p> <p>I sat at a back table, my back to the wall. Darkness masked what had been blue skies and puffy white clouds. Nighttime humidity rose as I waited, my anxiety not betraying me.</p> <p>A Maserati whipped up under the lights, pulled into the lot, and found an open space between my Streetfighter and a 7-series BMW. The Gran Turismo was beautiful. Gray coupe, red leather seats. It was her. That was her mode. Had been her style since she was coming up as a grifter in North Hollywood, back when she was a neophyte in the con game. She'd come up from sleeping on the streets to sleeping in penthouses. Had moved from Hyundai to Maserati.</p> <p>Every time I read about a major scam, it felt like it was her doing. Maybe I was just hoping it was her criminal mind in full swing. I kept telling myself that it didn't matter, but no matter where I was in the world, no matter what job I was on, no matter whose bed I was in, no matter who was in my bed, when all was said and done, my mind always went back to her.</p> <p>I needed her for her connections to the conniving world of high-tech cons and criminals.</p> <p>Someone out there knew about me, some unseen foe existed, someone who had tracked my movements around the world, someone who had sold my information to a problem I'd had in Detroit, and that information was then passed on to other killers.</p> <p>Those killers were dead, but the information was alive.</p> <p>Arizona eased out of her Maserati Granturismo and I couldn't stop my schoolboy smile.</p> <p>A part of me I couldn't control would always want her.</p> <p>Arizona's back was to me at first, her right hand holding her cellular to her ear. Her hair was long and dyed light brown with highlights, hung over her shoulders. She glanced toward the boulevard and I saw she had on dark shades with wide lenses, shades that matched the dark brown blouse she wore, a blouse that probably had hints of her lacy bra showing hints of her soft breasts.</p> <p>I spied out at the parking lot, made sure she wasn't trailed. Force of habit. Then I checked the room again. The teenaged guy wearing Dockers had made contact with the pretty blond woman in the pink button-down shirt and ripped jeans. He had scooted his chair closer to her table, smiled at her as she blushed at him.</p> <p>Arizona kept her eyes on the boulevard.</p> <p>She had on four-inch heels made by a designer who put red soles on all of his shoes. One glance at the Maserati and Louboutins and you'd think she had matriculated from one of the best schools in the country, maybe the prestigious Miss Porter's up in Connecticut.</p> <p>Arizona glanced back toward the coffeehouse, a serious look on her Filipina flesh, a walking enigma who could break a man's heart or empty every dime he had in his portfolio. She looked extraordinary, possessed an otherworldly beauty. No one would know she was the queen of scams. Just looked like a woman men would want to marry and put in a case with the rest of their trophies.</p> <p>I licked my lips, could never forget the five senses of her. I'd stop the world from spinning if she asked me to. I'd betray God the way Judas Iscariot betrayed His son. </p> <p>Arizona kept her cellular up to her face. A moment later, mine rang. Area code 809. Good old 809 had been disgraced, used in many Caribbean area codes scams.</p> <p>I answered, my voice heavy and serious. "I'm inside."</p> <p>Arizona closed her cellular.</p> <p>It had been over a year since I'd seen her.</p> <p>A lot had happened since then.</p> <p>She reached inside the car and took out a black briefcase, added that to the purse she was carrying. She gripped the briefcase by its handle, turned around, and what I saw her carrying made me sit up straight. </p> <p>My heart stopped beating. Then my heart restarted, began beating as fast as it could.</p> <p>Between Arizona's breasts and waist, there was roundness underneath her blouse.</p> <p>A roundness that told me she was at least in her second trimester.</p></p><h2>Samuel Rees Howells, a Life of Intercession: The Legacy of Hidden Intercessor</h2><p><p>Updated in 2018.

His walking tour of these Masonic sites includes both the expected and unexpected--from the Lincoln Memorial and the Capitol Building to the Federal Reserve complex, National Academy of Sciences, and the Library of Congress. Each location includes descriptions, interpretations, and explanations of the Masonic symbols and ritualistic meanings hidden within its structure, all illustrated with contemporary color and historic black-and-white photographs. <br> <br>Wasserman explains the purpose behind putting these symbols and Masonic designs into the capital and how all these monuments fit into the spiritual vision held by the Founding Fathers.

As well as providing exciting designs to stitch, there is guidance on how to create cross stitch designs of your own, for example by using photographs and other images for reference. <br><br>Jamie also showcases the work of other contemporary cross stitchers who are pushing the boundaries of their craft, and introduces more than 20 stunning cutting-edge projects to make, showing that beauty, innovation and 'craftivism' are alive and kicking in this inspirational book.</p><p>Jamie Chalmers took up cross stitching fifteen years ago and hes never looked back. <br><br>Since establishing the Mr X Stitch website in 2008, he has been showcasing new talent in the world of textiles and stitch and has curated a number of stitch-based exhibitions in the UK and Ireland.

Check out the full review:&nbsp; https://youtu.be/w8zMOSSq_Nc<br>-<i>Feb 18 2018<br><br></i><b>Peacock &amp; Fig Review - Feb 27, 2018</b><i><br></i>I was lucky enough to be contacted by the publisher of the newest cross stitch guide to hit the market,&nbsp;The Mr X Stitch Guide to Cross Stitch, and asked to give my honest feedback. I was thrilled to be contacted, I&#x2019;ve been a big fan of his for years and have worked with him on a few projects for his fantastic modern&nbsp;<b>XStitch</b> magazine. <b>Jamie &#x201c;Mr X Stitch&#x201d; Chalmers</b> used to have a regular column in CrossStitcher magazine, and his&nbsp;TEDX talk on cross stitch&nbsp;is so good. I knew his book would be good, but I didn&#x2019;t know how good until I got my copy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>First off, I have to give a shout out to the wonderful photographer Stacy Grant, her photos are so awesome (I&#x2019;m very jealous and wish I could take such nice photos of my own work). The whole vibe of the book is fun and relaxed, and definitely there&#x2019;s no trace of being pretentious or &#x201c;precious&#x201d; as some craft books can be. Jamie&#x2019;s personality shines through in his writing, and many times I laughed out loud at the way he phrased something.&nbsp;This section about the back of your work really made me lose it...<br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>"There&#x2019;s a myth going around town, an urban legend that says the back of your work should be as neat as the front. Usually started by a friend of a friend who knew an old lady with loads of cross stitch, who said that unless your back is really tidy, you&#x2019;ll all be sent to hell and your children will all have gills."</i><br>But what&#x2019;s in the book you say? Jamie has done a great job of not only covering the techniques and materials of cross stitch (with really clear photos and easy to understand instructions), but a wide variety of other topics that are part and parcel of stitching. He covers basic colour theory (perfect if you&#x2019;re wanting to experiment with colours in your projects or make your own), how to frame your projects, and explains how glow in the dark threads are seriously under-utilized and how to use them more easily. He even goes into why stitching is important in our lives, whether it&#x2019;s purely as a means to relaxation or connecting with our traditions of the past, but also as a means of &#x201c;craftivism&#x201d; and making change in your community and society.<br>&nbsp;<br>The book also contains a ton of useful information if you&#x2019;ve ever considered making your own patterns (including a variety of examples of one pattern produced at different sizes). He also delves into stitching on non-traditional materials, whether that&#x2019;s by using waste canvas or soluble Aida, or drilling holes into materials like leather, wood, or metal and stitching on that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie also features some really innovative cross stitch designers, and shows how they are pushing the boundaries of this craft.&nbsp;<b>Lord Libidan</b>&#x2018;s work in 3D stitching is featured, as is the fantastic metalwork stitched art of Lithuanian artist&nbsp;<b>Severija In&#x10d;irauskait&#x117;-Kriaunevi&#x10d;ien&#x117;</b>&nbsp;(cross stitched car, anyone?). Also featured is embroidery artist&nbsp;<b>Zoe Gilbertson</b>&nbsp;with her beautiful abstract colourful pieces, heavy metal inspired UK designer <b>Kate&nbsp;Blandford</b>, and street installation artists&nbsp;<b>Les Deuz&#x2019;Bro</b>.<br>&nbsp;<br>Throughout the book, there are sample patterns with full colour photos of the finished projects, and they are labelled according to difficulty level. There is a wide variety of fun projects, from a simple question mark that&#x2019;s meant to be displayed with the back showing, to a little version of the Mona Lisa. No matter your stitching level, there is something in this book for everyone, and I learned a lot reading it. If you&#x2019;re interested at all in cross stitch and its context in modern society, I&#x2019;d highly recommend picking up a copy.&nbsp;<br><i><br>Full review -&nbsp;https://peacockandfig.com/2018/02/review-the-mr-x-stitch-guide-to-cross-stitch/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=something_special_for_you_this_week&amp;utm_term=2018-03-14</i></p><h2>Philomena&#39;s New Glasses</h2><p><b>From the creator of <i>Ready Rabbit Gets Ready!</i> comes a hilarious photo-story of sisterhood and one-upmanship.</b><br><br>Philomena needs new glasses.

Who are his supporters? And why might their support now be faltering? Alive with the voices and experiences of ordinary Russians and elites alike, Sam Greene and Graeme Robertson craft a compellingly original account of contemporary Russian politics.<br><br> Telling the story of Putin&#x2019;s rule through pivotal episodes such as the aftermath of the "For Fair Elections" protests, the annexation of Crimea, and the War in Eastern Ukraine, Greene and Robertson draw on interviews, surveys, social media data, and leaked documents to reveal how hard Putin has to work to maintain broad popular support, while exposing the changing tactics that the Kremlin has used to bolster his popularity. Unearthing the ambitions, emotions, and divisions that fuel Russian politics, this book illuminates the crossroads to which Putin has led his country and shows why his rule is more fragile than it appears.</p><p><b>Sam Greene </b>is reader in Russian politics and director of the Russia Institute at King&#x2019;s College London. <b>Graeme Robertson</b> is professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and director of the Center for Slavic, Eurasian and East European Studies.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Negro&#39;s Civil War: How American Blacks Felt and Acted During the War for the Union</h2><p>In this classic study, Pulitzer Prize-winning author James M. McPherson deftly narrates the experience of blacks--former slaves and soldiers, preachers, visionaries, doctors, intellectuals, and common people--during the Civil War. Drawing on contemporary journalism, speeches, books, and letters, he presents an eclectic chronicle of their fears and hopes as well as their essential contributions to their own freedom. Through the words of these extraordinary participants, both Northern and Southern, McPherson captures African-American responses to emancipation, the shifting attitudes toward Lincoln and the life of black soldiers in the Union army. Above all, we are allowed to witness the dreams of a disenfranchised people eager to embrace the rights and the equality offered to them, finally, as citizens.</p><p>The experiences of blacks differed greatly from those of white during America's Civil War. In the North, against great opposition, black soldiers--when given the opportunity--fought valiantly on behalf of the Union. The South was a different story. Aside from life on the plantation, many slaves followed their masters to war, and on occasion fought for the Confederacy. There was also, of course, the underground railroad, helping escaped slaves to freedom. Pulitzer Prize-winning author James McPherson paints a stunning picture of the other side--the Negro's Civil War. If you've read BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, you must read this book to get the full picture.<br><br>Doug Grad, Editor&#x201c;McPherson shatters the belief that [blacks] were passive about their freedom.

He lives in Brooklyn, New York.Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;If your child regularly took apart machines in your home or trimmed down a tread on your stairs to make it sound better, how would you react? Fortunately for musicians and music lovers, Les Paul's mother encouraged, even praised, his efforts. From a young age, Les was curious about sound as it relates to music. His initial attempts to learn to play the piano ended with the teacher declaring, "Lester will never learn music..." but a mail-order guitar and a wooden harmonica proved to be just the ticket to launch his ever-widening curiosity about how to improve the sound so it would reach all the way to the back of crowds that came to hear him play. Each performance venue produced additional problems to solve, leading to more and more tinkering with found objects. His persistence and creativity paid off, as he is credited with numerous inventions that have made today's recorded music possible. Paul's story is delightfully told in folksy, familiar language, with numerous onomatopoeias to represent the sounds he produced. There is additional back matter that adds more detail to illuminate his amazing career accomplishments. Helquist's illustrations, created with colorful oils, are equally delightful and pleasant. Text and illustrations radiate exuberance and joy. Readers will marvel at the perseverance and ingenuity Paul demonstrated throughout his life. VERDICT A strong addition to inspire would-be inventors, and an excellent choice for STEM programs and biography collections.&#x2014;Maggie Chase, Boise State University, ID</p><h2>Homesteading Animals - Rearing Rabbits For Meat And Fur: Includes Rabbit, Duck, and Game recipes for the slow cooker (Hobby Farm Animals)</h2><p><b>REARING RABBITS - AMAZON NO 1 BEST SELLER! *** SECOND EDITION - UPDATED AND EXPANDED *** </b><br><br>In this Homesteading book by <b>Best Selling Author Norman J Stone</b>, Rabbits are in the spotlight.

Nettie can't forget these images, and she can't help but wonder what life would be like if she were a slave... <br>Based on the diary of the author's great-grandmother, this is a poignant and compelling look at slavery through the eyes of a young girl. Once read, it is not soon forgotten.</p><p>Ann Turner is an award-winning screenwriter and director, avid reader, and history lover.

An interest in American Indian culture first brought Mr. Himler to the southwest, and his work often features western subjects as well as historical themes. His paintings are frequently exhibited in galleries in the southwest. Ron Himler has illustrated more than seventy-five children&#x2019;s books.Turner's Dakota Dugout and Third Girl from the Left proved her ability to write of the settlers' hard lives on the Plains. This time she presents, in the form of a sparely written, evocative letter to a friend, a young girl's impressions of the South and her first encounter with slavery. Traveling with her sister and journalist brother, Nettie learns that, according to the Constitution, slaves are only 3/5 people. She looks to see what comprises the 2/5 they are missing. And she meets Tabitha, who only has that one name, "Like a cat or a dog." She throws up when she sees two black children who have to be forcefully separated when they are auctioned off to different owners. Nettie is changed when she returns home. The historical distance makes this fact-based account no less heart-wrenching and realistic. Himler's black-and-white pencil drawings are somber, yet in those scenes of past sorrows, there are glimpses of hope.

Antonio Escohotado demonstrates how the history of drugs illuminates the history of humanity as he explores the long relationship between mankind and mind-altering substances. Hemp, for example, has been used in India since time immemorial to stimulate mental agility and sexual prowess. Aristotle's disciple Theophrastus testifies to the use of datura by the ancient Greeks and further evidence links the rites at Eleusis to the ingestion of a hallucinogen. Similar examples can be found in cultures as diverse as the Celts, the ancient Egyptians, the Aztecs, and other indigenous peoples around the world. <br><br>Professor Escohotado also looks at the present-day differences that exist between the more drug-tolerant societies like Holland and Switzerland and countries advocating complete repression of these substances. The author provides a comprehensive analysis of the enormous social costs of the drug war that is coming under increasing fire from all levels of society. Professor Escohotado's work demonstrates that drugs have always existed and been used by societies throughout the world and the contribution they have made to humanity's development has been enormous. The choice we face today is to teach people how to use them correctly or to continue to indiscriminately demonize them. "Just say no," the author says, is not an option. Just say "know" is. <br><br>Antonio Escohotado is a professor of philosophy and social science methodology at the National University of Distance Education in Madrid, Spain.

Marijuana, for example, has been used in India since time immemorial to stimulate mental agility and sexual prowess, and a census in 312 c.e. revealed nearly 800 stores in the city of Rome devoted to selling opium.

In a striking full-color collage, each spread of <i>Biggest, Strongest, Fastest</i> portrays an animal that stands out in the animal world as the largest, slowest, longest lived. Readers can see the animal's size in relation to something familiar, and a chart on the last page indicates the size, weight, and diet of each animal, as well as where it can be found in the wild. <i>Biggest, Strongest, Fastest</i> is an entertaining, informative introduction to the "world records" held by fourteen members of the animal kingdom.</p></p><p><p><b>Steve Jenkins </b>has written and illustrated many nonfiction picture books for young readers, including the Caldecott Honor-winning <i>What Do You Do with a Tail Like This?</i> His books have been called stunning, eye-popping, inventive, gorgeous, masterful, extraordinary, playful, irresistible, compelling, engaging, accessible, glorious, and informative.

Beautiful double-page-spread cut-paper collages illustrate a picture book about "some of the biggest and smallest, fastest and slowest, strongest and longest" record holders in the animal world. The facts are amazing. Their juxtaposition makes you gasp, not just about size and speed but about comparative wonders. Right after the African elephant, which eats more than 300 pounds of grass and leaves every day, there's a close-up two-page picture of an ant, which turns out to be the strongest animal <i>for its size</i>: it can carry five times its own weight. The book's design makes it accessible at many levels. The youngest can identify the various creatures. Preschoolers can enjoy the one-sentence descriptions in large type ("The cheetah can run faster than any other animal. . . . The flea is very small, but it is the world's best jumper"). Older kids will love thinking about the additional facts regarding scale and proportion that are printed in small type, accompanied by a tiny silhouette in the corner of each picture ("If a 5 1/2-foot-tall woman could jump as well as a flea, she could leap to the top of a 65-story building").

Blood may be a highly charged substance, symbolic of our spirit and essential for life, but we can gain much from reflecting on its power over us. Science journalist Douglas Starr has examined the history of blood's medical uses, and his report is at once intellectually engaging and emotionally compelling. <i>Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce</i> covers the late 17th century to the present, detailing experiments with animal blood (one violent madman was briefly calmed by infused calf's blood), the long ban on transfusions, direct artery-to-vein suture between donor and recipient, and today's global blood-banking industry. It's a great story that shows the long climb from great risk and heroism to relative safety.<p> Our greatest stumble during this climb--the AIDS crisis of the 1980s--is the meat of the book. How could it have happened? Why were so many people given contaminated blood products <i>after</i> clear warnings about the risks of infection? Starr is unafraid to name names and lay bare the political and financial decisions that condemned so many thousands of hemophiliacs and surgical patients to early deaths. Those who don't learn from the past are bound to repeat it; Starr aims to help us keep the blood off of our hands. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Douglas Starr's history of blood in science, medicine, and commerce is<br><br>"Fascinating...A rich story admirably told"--<i>New York Times</i><br><br>"Extraordinarily intriguing"--<i>Science News</i><br><br>"Definitive...an outstanding chronicle"--<i>Atlanta Journal</i><br><br>"Illuminating...More than historical narrative...Starr also provokes a good deal of thought about the mismanagement of this 'precious and dangerous medicine'"--<i>Boston Globe</i><br><br>"Gripping"--<i>Newsday</i><br><br>"'An exhaustive exposeï¿½ of the worldwide business of blood.

It was all I could read before a flood tide of emotion took my breath away and the text before me was splintered by the diamonds in my eyes. Tears had coursed down my cheeks as thoughts of her returned to me: the impish child, racing through the hallways of the great Palace of Versailles; the firebrand I came to know and love in adulthood, tresses of red hair across her shoulders, eyes intense beneath dark and lustrous lashes. She had the balance of the expert dancer and the master swordsman. She was as comfortable gliding across the floor of the palace beneath the desirous eye of every man in the room as she was in combat.</p><p>But behind those eyes lay secrets. Secrets I was about to discover. I pick up her journal once again, wanting to place my palm and fingertips to the page, caress the words, feeling that on this page lies part of her very soul.</p><p>I begin to read.<br><br><b>EXTRACTS FROM THE JOURNAL OF ï¿½LISE DE LA SERRE</b></p><p>9 APRIL 1778</p><p>i</p><p>My name is ï¿½lise de la Serre. My father is Franï¿½ois, my mother Julie, and we live in Versailles: glittering, beautiful Versailles, where neat buildings and grand chï¿½teaus reside in the shadow of the great palace, with its lime-tree avenues, its shimmering lakes and fountains, its exquisitely tended topiary.</p><p>We are nobles. The lucky ones. The privileged. For proof we need only take the fifteen-mile road into Paris. It is a road lit by overhanging oil lamps, because in Versailles we use oil lamps, but in Paris the poor use tallow candles, and the smoke from the tallow factories hangs over the city like a death shroud, dirtying the skin and choking the lungs. Dressed in rags, their backs hunched either with the weight of their physical burden or of mental sorrow, the poor people of Paris creep through streets that never seem to get light. The streets stream with open sewers, where mud and human effluent flow freely, coating the legs of those who carry our sedan chairs as we pass through, staring wide-eyed out the windows.</p><p>Later we take gilded carriages back to Versailles and pass figures in the fields, shrouded in mist like ghosts. These barefooted peasants tend noble land and starve if the crop is bad, virtual slaves of the landowners. At home I listen to my parents&#x2019; tales of how they must stay awake to swish sticks at frogs whose croaking keeps landowners awake; how they must eat grass to stay alive; how the nobles are exempt from paying taxes, excused from military service and spared the indignity of the corvï¿½e, a day&#x2019;s unpaid labor working on the roads.</p><p>My parents say Queen Marie Antoinette roams the hallways, ballrooms and vestibules of the palace dreaming up new ways to spend her dress allowance while her husband King Louis XVI lounges on his lit de justice, passing laws that enrich the lives of nobles at the expense of the poor and starving. They talk darkly of how these actions might foment revolution.</p><p>My father had certain &#x201c;associates.&#x201d; His advisers, Messieurs Chretien Lafreniï¿½re, Charles Gabriel Sivert, and Madame Levesque. &#x201c;The Crows,&#x201d; I called them, with their long black coats, dark felt hats and eyes that never smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;Have we not learned the lessons of the Croquants?&#x201d; says my mother.</p><p>Mother had told me about the Croquants, of course. Those peasant revolutionaries of two centuries ago.</p><p>&#x201c;It would appear not, Julie,&#x201d; Father replies.</p><p>There is an expression to describe the moment you suddenly understand something that had previously been a mystery to you. It is the moment when &#x201c;the penny drops.&#x201d;</p><p>As a small child, it never occurred to me to wonder why I learned history, not etiquette, manners and poise; I didn&#x2019;t question why Mother joined Father and the Crows after dinner, her voice raised in disagreement to debate with as much force as they ever did; I never wondered why she didn&#x2019;t ride sidesaddle, nor why she never needed a groom to steady her mount, and I never wondered why she had so little time for fashion or court gossip. Not once did I think to ask why my mother was not like other mothers.</p><p>Not until the penny dropped.</p><p>ii</p><p>She was beautiful, of course, and always well dressed though she had no time for the manner of finery worn by the women at court, of whom she would purse her lips and talk disapprovingly. According to her they were obsessed with looks, status, with things.</p><p>&#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t know an idea if it hit them between the eyes, ï¿½lise. Promise me you&#x2019;ll never end up like them.&#x201d;</p><p>Intrigued and wanting to know more about how I should never end up, I used my vantage point at the hem of Mother&#x2019;s skirt to spy on these hated women. What I saw were overpowdered gossips who pretended they were devoted to their husbands even as their eyes roamed the room over the rims of their fans, looking for unsuspecting lovers to snare. Unseen, I would glimpse behind the powdered mask, when the scornful laughter dried on their lips and the mocking look died in their eyes. I&#x2019;d see them for what they really were, which was frightened. Frightened of falling out of favor. Of slipping down the society ladder.</p><p>Mother was not like that. For one thing she couldn&#x2019;t have cared less about gossip. And I never saw her with a fan, and she hated powder, and she had no time whatsoever for charcoal beauty spots and alabaster skin, her sole concession to fashion being shoes. Otherwise, what attention she gave her comportment was for one reason and one reason only: to maintain decorum.</p><p>And she was absolutely devoted to my father. She stood by him&#x2014;at his side, though, never behind him&#x2014;she supported him, was unswervingly loyal to him, backing him in public even though behind closed doors they would debate and I would hear her cooling his temper.</p><p>It&#x2019;s been a long time, though, since I last heard her debating with Father.</p><p>They say she may die tonight.</p><p>i</p><p>She survived the night.</p><p>I sat by her bedside, held her hand and spoke to her. For a while I had been under the delusion that it was me comforting her, until the moment she turned her head and gazed at me with milky but soul-searching eyes, and it became apparent that the opposite was true.</p><p>There were times last night when I gazed out of the window to see Arno in the yard below, envying how he could be so oblivious to the heartache just feet away from him. He knows she&#x2019;s ill, of course, but consumption is commonplace, death at the doctor&#x2019;s knee an everyday occurrence, even here in Versailles. And he is not a de la Serre. He is our ward, and thus not privy to our deepest, darkest secrets, nor our private anguish. Moreover, he has barely known any other state of affairs. For most of his time here. To Arno, Mother is a remote figure attended to on the upper floors of the chï¿½teau; to him she is defined purely by her illness.</p><p>Instead, my father and I share our turmoil via hidden glances. Outwardly we take pains to appear as normal, our mourning mitigated by two years of grim diagnosis. Our grief is another secret hidden from our ward.</p><p>ii</p><p>We&#x2019;re getting closer to the moment that the penny dropped. And thinking about the first incident, the first time I really began to wonder about my parents, and specifically Mother, I imagine it like a signpost along the road toward my destiny.</p><p>It happened at the convent. I was just five when I first entered it, and my memories of it are far from fully formed. Just impressions, really: long rows of beds; a distinct but slightly disconnected memory of glancing outside a window crowned with frost and seeing the tops of the trees rising above billowing skirts of mist; and . . . the Mother Superior.</p><p>Bent over and bitter, the Mother Superior was known for her cruelty. She&#x2019;d wander the corridors of the convent with her cane across her palms as though presenting it to a banquet. In her office it was laid across her desk. Back then we&#x2019;d talk of it being &#x201c;your turn,&#x201d; and for a while it was mine, when she hated my attempts at happiness, begrudged the fact that I was swift to laughter and would always call my happy smile a smirk. The cane, she said, would wipe that smirk off my face.</p><p>Mother Superior was right about that. It did. For a while.</p><p>And then one day Mother and Father arrived to see the Mother Superior on what matter I have no idea, and I was called to the office at their request. There I found my parents turned in their seats to greet me, Mother Superior standing from behind her desk, the usual look of undisguised contempt upon her face, a frank assessment of my many shortcomings only just dry on her lips.</p><p>If it had been Mother alone to see me, I should not have been so formal. I would have run to her and hoped I might slip into the folds of her dress and into another world out of that horrible place. But it was both of them, and my father was my king. It was he who dictated what modes of politeness we abided by; he who had insisted I was placed in the convent in the first place. So I approached and curtsied and waited to be addressed.</p><p>My mother snatched up my hand. How she even saw what was there I have no idea, since it was by my side, but somehow she&#x2019;d caught a glimpse of the marks left by the cane.</p><p>&#x201c;What are these?&#x201d; she demanded of the Mother Superior, holding my hand toward her.</p><p>I had never seen the Mother Superior look anything less than composed. But now I would say that she paled. In an instant my mother had transformed from proper and polite, just what was expected of a guest of the Mother Superior, to an instrument of potential anger. We all felt it. Mother Superior the most.</p><p>She stammered a little. &#x201c;As I was saying, ï¿½lise is a willful girl and disruptive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So she&#x2019;s caned?&#x201d; demanded my mother, her anger rising.</p><p>Mother Superior squared her shoulders. &#x201c;How else do you expect me to keep order?&#x201d;</p><p>Mother snatched up the cane. &#x201c;I expect you to be able to keep order. Do you think this makes you strong?&#x201d; She slapped the cane to the table. Mother Superior jumped and swallowed and her eyes darted to my father, who was keeping watch with an odd, unreadable expression, as though these were events that did not require his participation. &#x201c;Well, then you are sorely mistaken,&#x201d; added Mother. &#x201c;It makes you weak.&#x201d;</p><p>She stood, glaring at the Mother Superior, and made her jump again as she slapped the cane to the desk a second time. Then she took my hand. &#x201c;Come along, ï¿½lise.&#x201d;</p><p>We left, and from then on I have had tutors to teach me schoolwork.</p><p>I knew one thing as we bustled out of the convent and into our carriage for a silent ride home. As Mother and Father bristled with things left unsaid, I knew that ladies did not behave the way my mother had just done. Not normal ladies, anyway.</p><p>Another clue. This happened a year or so later, at a birthday party for a spoiled daughter in a neighboring chï¿½teau. Other girls my age played with dolls, setting them up to take tea, only a tea for dolls, where there was no real tea or cake, just little girls pretending to feed tea and cake to dolls, which to me, even then, seemed stupid.</p><p>Not far away the boys were playing with toy soldiers, so I stood to join them, oblivious to the shocked silence that fell over the gathering.</p><p>My nursemaid Ruth dragged me away. &#x201c;You play with dolls, ï¿½lise,&#x201d; she said, firmly but nervously, her eyes darting as she shrank beneath the disapproving stare of other nursemaids. I did as I was told, sinking to my haunches and affecting interest in the pretend tea and cake, and with the embarrassing interruption over, the lawn returned to its natural state: boys playing with toy soldiers, the girls with their dolls, nursemaids watching us both, and not far away a gaggle of mothers, highborn ladies who gossiped on wrought-iron lawn chairs.</p><p>I looked at the gossiping ladies and saw them with Mother&#x2019;s eyes. I saw my own path from girl on the grass to gossiping lady, and with a rush of absolute certainty realized I didn&#x2019;t want that. I didn&#x2019;t want to be like those mothers. I wanted to be like my own mother, who had excused herself from the gaggle of gossips and could be seen in the distance, alone, at the water&#x2019;s edge, her individuality plain for all to see.</p><p>iii</p><p>I have had a note from Mr. Weatherall. Writing in his native English, he tells me that he wishes to see Mother and asks that I meet him in the library at midnight to escort him to her room. He urges me not to tell Father.</p><p>Yet another secret I must keep. Sometimes I feel like one of those poor wretches we see in Paris, hunched over beneath the weight of expectations forced upon me.</p><p>I am only ten years old.</p><p>11 APRIL 1778</p><p>i</p><p>At midnight, I pulled on a gown, took a candle and crept downstairs to the library, where I waited for Mr. Weatherall.</p><p>He had let himself into the chï¿½teau, moving like a mystery, the dogs undisturbed, and when he entered the library so quietly that I barely even heard the door open and close, he crossed the floor in a few strides, snatched his wig from his head&#x2014;the accursed thing, he hated it&#x2014;and grasped my shoulders.</p><p>&#x201c;They say she is fading fast,&#x201d; he said, and needed it to be hearsay.</p><p>&#x201c;She is,&#x201d; I told him, dropping my gaze.</p><p>His eyes closed, and though he was not at all old&#x2014;in his mid-thirties, the same age as Mother and Father&#x2014;the years were etched upon his face.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Weatherall and I were once very close,&#x201d; Mother had said before. She&#x2019;d smiled as she said it. I fancy that she blushed.</p><p>ii</p><p>It was a freezing-cold day in February the first time I met Mr. Weatherall. That winter was the first of the really cruel winters, but while in Paris the River Seine had flooded and frozen, and the poverty-stricken were dying in the streets, things were very different in Versailles. By the time we awoke, the staff had made up the fires that roared in the grates, and we ate steaming breakfast and wrapped up warm in furs, our hands kept warm by muffs as we took morning and afternoon strolls in the grounds.</p><p>That particular day the sun was shining although it did nothing to offset the bone-chilling cold. A crust of ice sparkled prettily on a thick layer of snow, and it was so hard that Scratch, our Irish wolfhound, was able to walk upon it without his paws sinking in. He&#x2019;d taken a few tentative steps, then on realizing his good fortune, given a joyous bark and dashed off ahead while Mother and I made our way across the grounds and to the trees at the perimeter of the south lawn.</p><p>Holding her hand, I glanced over my shoulder as we walked. Far away our chï¿½teau shone in the reflection of sun and snow, its windows winking, then, as we stepped out of the sun and into the trees, it became indistinct, as though shaded by pencils. We were farther out than usual, I realized, no longer within reach of its shelter.</p><p>&#x201c;Do not be alarmed if you see a gentleman in the shadows,&#x201d; said Mother, bending to me slightly. Her voice was quiet. I clutched her hand a little tighter at the very idea and she laughed. &#x201c;Our presence here is no coincidence.&#x201d;</p><p>I was six years old then and had no idea that a lady meeting a man in such circumstances might have &#x201c;implications.&#x201d; As far as I was concerned, it was simply my mother meeting a man, and of no greater sign...</p></p><h2>How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market</h2><p>Nicolas Darvas was a world famous dancer and a self taught investor.

It is based on Mireille Miller-Young's extensive archival research and her interviews with dozens of women who have worked in the adult entertainment industry since the 1980s. The women share their thoughts about desire and eroticism, black women's sexuality and representation, and ambition and the need to make ends meet. Miller-Young documents their interventions into the complicated history of black women's sexuality, looking at individual choices, however small&#x2014;a costume, a gesture, an improvised line&#x2014;as small acts of resistance, of what she calls "illicit eroticism." Building on the work of other black feminist theorists, and contributing to the field of sex work studies, she seeks to expand discussion of black women's sexuality to include their eroticism and desires, as well as their participation and representation in the adult entertainment industry. Miller-Young wants the voices of black women sex workers heard, and the decisions they make, albeit often within material and industrial constraints, recognized as their own.<br></p><p>Mireille Miller-Young is Associate Professor of Feminist Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She is a coeditor of <i>The Feminist Porn Book: The Politics of Producing Pleasure</i>.<br>&#x201c;This much-needed volume reminds scholars of the need to deepen porn studies and strengthen its interdisciplinary possibilities through various theoretical lenses and critical approaches. &nbsp;Supporting her book with abundant images, Miller-Young thoughtfully exposes readers to concepts both visually and intellectually. ... &nbsp;A necessary volume for academics as well as those interested in popular culture studies that have a dialogue with race and/or women.

If<i> A Taste for Brown Sugar </i>can produce a solid analysis of such a difficult, controversial topic, Miller-Young has set a high bar for similar projects that study oppositional knowledge." (Patricia Hill Collins <i>The Journal of American History</i> 2015-12-01)<br><br>"[E]ssential reading for anyone seeking to understand new work on feminism, critical race studies, pornography, and film history." (Svati P. Shah <i>Women's Review of Books</i> 2015-09-01)<br><br>"<i>A Taste for Brown Sugar</i> is a necessary, long overdue text that should interest scholars and students of various fields and backgrounds, particularly those interested in feminist theory, media studies, histories of black women, sex work, and of course porn studies.... The book is impressive, cultivating a rich and diverse tapestry of urgent voices and images, revealing the complicated interplay between labor and representation."

(Sherri L. Barnes <i>Feminist Collections</i> 2015-08-01)<br><br>"Miller-Young offers a compelling examination of African American women&#x2019;s participation in one of the nation&#x2019;s most understudied industries: the porn business. Filling a void within African American women&#x2019;s historiography and presenting a more nuanced perspective on women&#x2019;s work, she situates black female porn laborers within the larger context of 20th-century work. Miller-Young has produced a bold and engaging study that challenges historians of the black female experiences to re-conceptualize ideas about race and gender and labor and black sexualities." (LaShawn Harris <i>Souls</i> 2016-06-01)<br><br>"In a field so dominated by the visual, it is Miller-Young&#x2019;s insistence that we hear, as well as see, black women in porn that makes her book so textured, colorful, brash, and critically engrossing. Divided into six well-written and informative chapters, this ambitious scholarly tour de force offers an ethnographic account of black women&#x2019;s labor in the porn industry, as well as a historicist cultural appraisal of blackness in pornography from the early twentieth century into our present era." (L. H. Stallings <i>Black Camera</i> 2015-03-01)<br><br>"Throughout six chapters of insightful and rigorous thought, Miller-Young traces the evolution of black sex actors as a heavily stereotyped spectacle during the silent era to a more nuanced and contemporary understanding of them as working professionals seeking, and oftentimes finding, autonomy and female sexual empowerment.&nbsp;<i>A Taste for Brown Sugar</i>&nbsp;is a leap forward in feminist thinking and sex work studies, and a crucial read for any student of women's studies." (Laura L. S. Bauer <i>Women's Studies</i> 2015-08-06)<br><br>"All those who are interested in porn, African American, film, cultural or queer studies would benefit from reading this multifaceted, nuanced, decidedly non-white interpretation of the porn industry."

Scott Dannemiller and his wife, Gabby, are former missionaries who served in Guatemala. Ten years removed from their vow of simple living, they found themselves on a never-ending treadmill of consumption where each purchase created a desire for more and never led to true satisfaction. The difference between needs and wants had grown very fuzzy, and making that distinction clear again would require drastic action: no nonessential purchases for a whole year. No clothes, no books, no new toys for the kids. If they couldn't eat it or use it up within a year (toilet paper and shampoo, for example), they wouldn't buy it.</p><p> Filled with humorous wit, curious statistics, and poignant conclusions, the book examines modern America's spending habits and chronicles the highs and lows of dropping out of our consumer culture. As the family bypasses the checkout line to wrestle with the challenges of gift giving, child rearing, and keeping up with the Joneses, they discover important truths about human nature and the secret to finding true joy. <i>The Year without a Purchase</i> offers valuable food for thought for anyone who has ever wanted to reduce stress by shopping less and living more.</p></p><p><p><b>Scott Dannemiller</b> is a writer, blogger, worship leader, and former missionary with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).

They had fully fleshed-out songs and whispers and rumors of half-formed ones. They had songs that followed a hard-to-gauge internal logic. They had punk tunes and country tunes and sad tunes and funny ones. They had fuzzy pop and angular new wave. They had raunchy guitar solos and stoner blues. They had pristine jangle and pedal steel.

That way, you'll always be warm, safe, happy, and well fed wherever you go.<br><br>Grow Up<br><br>"Talk to plants, and they will grow. Life without love, for all living things, is nothing. If you give love to something, it will reciprocate. That's how we are as humans, too."<br><br>-Angel Rodriguez<br><br>How to Plant a Tree<br><br>Step 1: Choose the right tree. Consider not only its size, speed of growth, shape, and looks, but also its hardiness. It should be native to your area and strong enough to weather the hottest and coldest temperatures, and all the sunshine and rain you may or may not get. Other things to think about: Will your tree lose its leaves every year (and do you really want to rake them)? Does it bear fruit (and if so, will you eat it or curse it when it's smushed on the bottom of your shoe)?<br><br>Step 2: Find a good spot. Look up, look down, look all around and make sure your tree will have plenty of space to thrive. Your tree may look small now, but it won't be for very long, and if you plant a soon-to- be-big sucker right next to your house or directly under utility lines, you'll be paying for that bad decision for years to come. Also, a no-brainer: Before digging any holes, call your local utility company to make sure you're clear of any underground cables.<br><br>Step 3: Dig a hole. A well-planted tree will grow faster and live longer than a poorly planted tree, so take care to do it right. Using a shovel, dig a big ol' bowl-shaped hole as deep as the tree's roots (or root-ball) and at least twice as wide. The hole will most certainly look bigger than you think it needs to be, but the roots need that extra room to grow. Don't slack on the digging.<br><br>Step 4: Measure up. Place your tree in the hole and see if it's deep enough. If it's just right, proceed to step 5. If it's too deep, put some soil back. If it's too shallow, go have a lemonade. Then come back and keep digging.<br><br>Step 5: Position your tree. It should stand upright in the center of the hole. If your tree comes in a container, tap the pot to gently remove it, being careful not to rip the trunk from the roots. If your tree comes with its roots wrapped in burlap, plunk the whole thing in the pit and carefully remove the burlap, along with any twine, wire, nails, or staples.<br><br>Step 6: Fill the hole. Replace the soil you removed, packing it down firmly around the roots. You'll want your tree pit to catch water, so make sure your tree grows from the pit's deepest point. Then look for a little bulge at the base of your tree's trunk. It's called the root collar, and you want your soil to snuggle its bottom only. If you can't see your tree's collar, it may be planted too deep.<br><br>Step 7: Add water. Give the ground a good soak.<br><br>Step 8: Spread mulch (wood chips or bark) around your tree a couple of inches deep. It'll help keep the soil warm and moist, prevent weeds and erosion, and just make the whole thing look nice.<br><br>Step 9: Feel proud. Not only do trees help beautify the world, but they also help you save on energy costs, improve your water and air quality, give a home to songbirds, boost your property value, and fight global warming. Take good care of it by watering it once a week and pruning only dead or broken branches.<br><br>More Handy Tips:<br><br>To find the best trees for your area, enter your zip code at ArborDay.org and get all the information you've ever dreamed of. Better yet, join the Arbor Day Foundation for ten dollars, and you'll receive ten free trees of your choice. Seriously.<br><br>If you're planting a sapling with naked roots, remove any packaging and soak the roots in a bucket of water for up to six hours before planting.<br><br>If you're planting a tree that came in a pot and the roots look tangled once they're free, use a utility knife and make an X on the bottom of the root-ball and a vertical line down each side.<br><br>Aim True<br><br>"By the time I was six, I was splitting wood. Make sure you've got it lined up right and then go from there. It's not about muscle. The ax will do the work for you, but you can help it a little bit. If you're lucky, you'll hit it and have two pieces of wood. Usually, it takes a few blows. And don't cut your feet!"<br><br>-Philip Spooner<br><br>How to Split Firewood<br><br>Step 1: Dress appropriately. Wear safety goggles, leather work gloves, steel-toed boots, and a plaid flannel shirt, if you've got one. The first three items will help protect you from harm, while the last one will make you look butch. You'll also need a maul, which is basically a fatter version of an ax built specifically for splitting wood vertically, as opposed to chopping across it. (Axes will work, too, but because they're slimmer, they tend to get stuck in the wood more often, and that's just frustrating.)<br><br>Step 2: Set a twelve- to eighteen-inch log on end on a raised, flat wooden surface about fourteen inches tall. The perfect chopping block: a sawed-off tree stump. Your second-best option: on the soft ground. You may have to wrest your maul from the depths of the dirt sometimes, but that'll only help you build stronger muscles. Never ever split wood on pavement, or you and anybody in your vicinity will get hurt. Flying shards of steel? Not fun.<br><br>Step 3: Get in position, and eyeball where you'd like to split the wood. Cracks are nature's way of helping you along, so take advantage of them. Once you've focused on your target, place the sharp edge of your maul on it and, with your arms fully extended, grip the end of the handle with both hands. Step back a few inches so you're slightly reaching, and plant your feet shoulder-width apart.<br><br>Step 4: Prepare to strike. Pick up your maul and hold it parallel to the ground, across the front of your body, blade facing away from you. Place your weak hand at the base of the handle, palm facing down, and your dominant hand closer to the head, palm facing up. Grunt for good measure.<br><br>Step 5: Swing deep. Slightly bend your knees, and then raise your maul overhead with your arms extended, allowing your dominant hand to slide to the base of the handle. Keeping your eye on your target, swing your maul in a downward motion to meet the wood. Find the grace in the movement. Every woodsman knows that technique (and gravity) counts more than brute strength.<br><br>Step 6: Repeat as necessary. Maybe it'll take one good crack, maybe more. Just keep hitting your log in the same place until it splits. Then keep going until you have your desired amount of splits. Save the little pieces, too. They make great kindling.<br><br>Step 7: Stack 'em up and let 'em dry. If it's new wood, it'll be ready to burn in about nine months. If it's already seasoned, it's ready to burn now.<br><br>More Handy Tips<br><br>Knotty, gnarly, or curvy wood can be tough to split. Save those pieces for last or, better yet, just use them for decoration.<br><br>To gain more momentum in your swing, rise up on your toes before dropping your maul.<br><br>If your maul does get stuck, keep a few steel wedges nearby and tap them into the wood with a little sledgehammer. That'll usually be enough to split the log into pieces and free your tool.<br><br>Always remember, the best cure for a hot head and a cold house: splitting wood. Do it as often as necessary.<br><br>Stay Warm<br><br>"We used to go camping when I was a boy. We'd put a lean-to in our packs and head out and live off the country for three or four days. If you spend a night in the woods and you don't know how to build a fire, you're going to be cold."<br><br>-Bill Holloman<br><br>How to Build a Fire<br><br>Step 1: Find a good spot. Look for a clearing, one that's far away from houses, trees, roots, and overhanging branches and also sheltered from the wind. Then clear a circle about three feet across, brush or dig out the center so it's slightly concave, and place big, dry rocks around the edge.<br><br>Step 2: Gather your supplies: matches, tinder (twigs, dried grasses and leaves, newspaper, and so on), kindling (sticks smaller than your wrist), two or three dry, split, seasoned logs about twelve to eighteen inches long, and a pail of water (or sand or dirt) for safety.<br><br>Step 3: Build a tepee-shaped blaze. Just toss your tinder into the center, leaving space for oxygen to circulate around it. Stand your smallest pieces of kindling on end to form a pyramid over your tinder. Repeat with three or four larger pieces of kindling. Then, without knocking the whole thing over, hold your breath and very gently lean a couple of logs on top. Exhale.<br><br>Step 4: Strike a match, light your tinder, and watch it all go up in flames, just as you'd hoped. Once the fire really gets roaring, the logs will topple over the hot coals to keep burning. Add more logs as needed, being careful you don't smother the flames.<br><br>Step 5: Get out your s'more fixin's and let the ghost stories begin. Did you hear the one about the guy with a hook for a hand? What about the girl with the ribbon around her neck? Come to think of it, who is that standing behind that tree?<br><br>More Handy Tips<br><br>If there's not a lot of tinder around, you might have to get creative. Try dried pine needles, pieces of papery birch bark, a fallen bird's nest (pulled apart), or even the fluff from a cattail (ahem, the kind that grows in wetlands, not the kind that is connected to your neighbor's kitty). Pine pitch (or sap) will always light, even on wet days. So will a cotton ball swabbed with Vaseline.<br><br>To identify good fire logs, knock two together. If you hear a clunk, they're ready to burn. If you hear a thud, they're probably still too wet to do anything but smoke you out.<br><br>Never build your fire on top of rocks, and never toss rocks into it, either. Hot rocks can explode, possibly causing harm to anyone nearby.<br><br>Never leave an unattended fire burning. Always, always put it out, using water, sand, or dirt.<br><br>To prevent your matches from getting wet, dip their tips in wax and store them in an empty film canister.<br><br>No matches? Build a fire plow. Find a piece of soft wood about a foot or two long and a very hard, pointy stick, about a foot long. Rub the point of your stick along the grain of the soft wood until you form a groove. When you see saw dust collecting, rub faster; you'll eventually get a tiny burning ember. Touch it to your tinder, and ignite your blaze. It may not be the quickest way to start a fire, but it sure beats freezing your you-know-what off.<br><br>Stay Afloat<br><br>"We had tin boat races in the basin, and they were thrilling. You'd fold up a piece of corrugated iron, about three feet wide and eight feet long, and fasten it together on the ends with screws and tar. I had one that I called the Orchid, which I painted lavender. I was doing real well in the race, but then I got too exuberant and I capsized it and it sank. Of course, I swam down and brought it back up again!"<br><br>-Buck Buchanan<br><br>How to Paddle a Canoe<br><br>Step 1: Climb aboard. This is the hardest thing you'll do all day, but if you can get in a canoe without tipping it, then you'll be golden on the pond. Just stay low in a crouched position, step as close to the centerline as possible, and slide both hands along the sides to steady yourself as you walk toward your seat. If you're alone, sit in the back of the boat.<br><br>Step 2: Grab your paddle. If you're right-handed, grip the paddle with your left hand on top of the handle and your right hand on the shaft, closer to the blade. To check your grip, hold the paddle in front of you, parallel to the water. Your arms should be just slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.<br><br>Step 3: Use the simple J-stroke, so you don't have to be bothered switching sides with every paddle. While keeping your chin up and back straight, reach high with your paddle and then dive it into the water just ahead of your knees. The blade should be perpendicular to the boat and fully submerged. Then draw your paddle alongside the boat, and when your left hand is extended across your body and your right hand is even with your hips, turn the blade parallel to the boat and use it as a rudder; push it gently away from you to scoop out a gentle J-shaped hook. (On the right side of the boat, it's actually a backward J.) Repeat the stroke from the start.<br><br>Step 4: Check your course. If you're paddling properly, you should be going in a straight line.<br><br>More Handy Tips<br><br>Always wear a life preserver and sunscreen when boating. Both can save your life.<br><br>When your arm gets tired, switch sides (and grips), and use the J- stroke on the other side. Remember, your J should always hook away from the boat.<br><br>Keep your boat straight in rapids and waves. If you approach either sideways, you'll swamp your boat, and it'll sink.<br><br>If you plan on paddling for a long time, bring water with you. A snack couldn't hurt, either. And toss a change of clothes in a dry bag, in case you happen to get wet.<br><br>Get Hooked<br><br>"When I was two and a half years old, my grandfather got an alder limb, a piece of twine, and a fishhook. He put an angleworm on the hook and set me loose at the creek behind our house. I caught a trout about four inches long! I came back and showed my mother. She didn't know I was fishin'! She looked at my grandfather and said, "You left him all alone?" My grandfather said, "He's old enough to go fishin'. See? He caught one!"?"<br><br>-Philip Spooner<br><br>How to Catch a Freshwater Fish<br><br>Step 1: Gather your equipment: a spinning rod and reel (with hook, line, and sinker attached); some bait; an ice-filled cooler for your catch; a sandwich, drink, and chips (for you, not the fish); and your fishing license. (Get one at your local bait shop before you go, or you may be hit with a very large fine. What's worse, you won't get to keep your catch or possibly even your equipment.)</p><h2>Senegal (Bradt Travel Guide)</h2><p>This new, thoroughly updated edition of Bradt's <em>Senegal </em>continues to offer far and away the greatest depth of coverage for this increasingly popular part of West Africa.

As a new century begins, Conquest offers an illuminating examination of our past failures and a guide to where we should go next. Graced with one of the most acute gifts for political prescience since Orwell, Conquest assigns responsibility for our century&#x2019;s cataclysms not to impersonal economic or social forces but to the distorted ideologies of revolutionary Marxism and National Socialism. The final, sobering chapters of <em>Reflections on a Ravaged Century</em> concern themselves with some coming storms, notably that of the European Union, which Conquest believes is an economic, cultural, and geographical misconception divisive of the West and doomed to failure. Winner of the Ingersoll Prize; winner of the Richard M. Weaver Prize; a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book. "Provides many glowing embers of reasoned and wise argument."&#x2015;Richard Bernstein, <em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp; "A book that ought to be required reading for everyone about to enter college, and by every member of Congress."&#x2015;Frank Wilson, <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></p><p>How can humankind avoid another century like the 20th? Blind devotion to obscene ideologies--Communism, Nazism--made the final hundred years of the millennium the bloodiest in human history. As Robert Conquest, author of <i>Reflections on a Ravaged Century</i>, notes, "Over this century the human race has survived experiences that, to put it mildly, should have been instructive. Scores of millions have been slaughtered, and it cannot be said that the avoidance of the even worse catastrophe of nuclear war was foreordained." Might it happen again? As Conquest is the author of <i>The Great Terror</i>, a devastating account of Stalin's crimes (and widely regarded as one of the 20th century's most important and influential works of history), any reflections he may have are worth noting. He's clearly worried, quoting, for example, the astonishing statement by Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm in 1994 that the construction of a Communist utopia can justify the murder of 20 million people.<p> <i>Reflections on a Ravaged Century</i> is primarily focused on the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, but he remains consistently forward-looking. "The power of fanaticism and of misunderstanding is by no means extinct," warns Conquest. The 20th century will be a prelude to even greater evils unless intellectuals engage in "a careful consideration of what needs to be learned, and unlearned." This book, both wise and accessible, is a good start. <i>--John J.

However, in recent years, some prominent evangelical authors have challenged this statement in their writings.<br><br>Now eminent apologist and bestselling author Norman L.

The free spirit enjoys running an organic gardening business on the island of Nantucket, thanks in large part to her spry grandmother Nona, who donated a portion of land on the family&#x2019;s seaside compound to get Charlotte started. Though Charlotte&#x2019;s skill with plants is bringing her success, cultivating something deeper with people&#x2014;particularly her handsome neighbor Coop&#x2014;might be more of a challenge.<br> <p>Nona&#x2019;s generosity to Charlotte, secretly her favorite grandchild, doesn&#x2019;t sit well with the rest of the Wheelwright clan, however, as they worry that Charlotte may be positioning herself to inherit the entire estate. With summer upon them, everyone is making their annual pilgrimage to the homestead&#x2014;some with hopes of thwarting Charlotte&#x2019;s dreams, others in anticipation of Nona&#x2019;s latest pronouncements at the annual family meeting, and still others with surprising news of their own. Charlotte&#x2019;s mother, Helen, a Wheelwright by marriage, brings a heavy heart. She once set aside her own ambitions to fit in with the Wheelwrights, but now she must confront a betrayal that threatens both her sense of place and her sense of self.</p> <p>As summer progresses, these three women&#x2014;Charlotte, Nona, and Helen&#x2014;come to terms with the decisions they have made. Revisiting the lives and loves that have crossed their paths and the possibilities of the roads not taken, they may just discover that what they&#x2019;ve always sought was right in front of them all along.</p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Nancy Thayer on <i>Summer House</i></strong><br><br> As a child, I thought my mother was the most beautiful woman in the world.

In words and pictures they provide a stunningly rich evocation of our beloved national pastime, a game woven inextricably into the fabric of our lives and our national memory. <br><br>Geoffrey C.

The book covers every milestone of the game: from the rules drawn up in 1845 by Alexander Cartwright to the American League&#x2019;s introduction of the designated hitter in 1973; from the founding of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players in 1885 to the eight-month players&#x2019; strike of 1994; from the 1924 Negro World Series (Kansas City Monarchs vs. Philadelphia Hilldales) to Jack Roosevelt Robinson&#x2019;s major-league debut in 1947; from the first curve ball in 1867 (pitched by Candy Cummings of the Brooklyn Excelsiors) to Nolan Ryan&#x2019;s seventh and last no-hitter in 1991.

In the absence of a written tradition, for generations of Skianachs, these tales, handed down orally, contained the very warp and weft of Hebridean history. They take us far beyond Christian times, to the edge of the Iron Age, and interweave with threads from the wider Atlantic tradition of Gaelic heroic myth and legend.</p><p>Otta Swire was born in 1898 and spent many happy childhood holidays in Skye, where she became captivated by the islands rich history of folklore and began recording them in notebooks.

Originally published in the UK over a half century ago, these books are still eagerly read by children, despite their length and their decidedly British protagonists. We attribute their success to two facts: first, Ransome is a great storyteller and, second, he clearly writes from first-hand experience. Independence and initiative are qualities any child can understand and every volume in this collection celebrates these virtues.<br><br>In this seventh adventure (following Pigeon Post, winner of the Carnegie Medal), the Walker family has come to Harwich to wait for Commander Walker's return. As usual, the children can't stay away from boats, and this time they meet young Jim Brading, skipper of the well-found sloop Goblin. But fun turns to high drama when the anchor drags, and the four young sailors find themselves drifting out to sea sweeping across to Holland in the midst of a full gale! As in all of Ransome's books, the emphasis is on self-reliance, courage, and resourcefulness. We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea is a story to warm any mariner's heart. Full of nautical lore and adventure, it will appeal to young armchair sailors and seasoned sailors alike.</p><p>&#x201c;He makes a tale of adventure a handbook to adventure.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Observer</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;There is plenty of excitement, a little danger, a quality of thinking, planning and fun which is delightful and stimulating.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>TLS</i>ARTHUR RANSOME was born in Leeds in 1884.

There is much more to the state, though, than stories of feuding families and Colonel Sanders' famous fried chicken. Kentucky has a rich and often compelling history, and James C. Klotter and Freda C. Klotter introduce readers to an exciting story that spans 12,000 years, looking at the lives of Kentuckians from Native Americans to astronauts. The Klotters examine all aspects of the state's history&#x2015;its geography, government, social life, cultural achievements, education, and economy. A Concise History of Kentucky recounts the events of the deadly frontier wars of the state's early history, the divisive Civil War, and the shocking assassination of a governor in 1900. The book tells of Kentucky's leaders from Daniel Boone and Henry Clay to Abraham Lincoln, Mary Breckinridge, and Muhammad Ali. The authors also highlight the lives of Kentuckians, both famous and ordinary, to give a voice to history. The Klotters explore Kentuckians' accomplishments in government, medicine, politics, and the arts. They describe the writing and music that flowered across the state, and they profile the individuals who worked to secure equal rights for women and African Americans. The book explains what it was like to work in the coal mines and explains the daily routine on a nineteenth-century farm. The authors bring Kentucky's story to the twenty-first century and talk about the state's modern economy, where auto manufacturing jobs are replacing traditional agricultural work. A collaboration of the state historian and an experienced educator, A Concise History of Kentucky is the best single resource for Kentuckians new and old who want to learn more about the past, present, and future of the Bluegrass State.</p><p>James C.

This book is the fruit of over 30 years of research and hundreds of exclusive interviews with a remarkable level of access to the very closest circles of the Jackson family - including Michael himself. Cutting through tabloid rumours, J. Randy Taraborrelli traces the real story behind Michael Jackson, from his drilling as a child star through the blooming of his talent to his ever-changing personal appearance and bizarre publicity stunts. This major biography includes the behind-the-scenes story to many of the landmarks in Jackson&#39;s life: his legal and commercial battles, his marriages to Lisa Marie Presley and Debbie Rowe, his passions and addictions, his children. Objective and revealing, it carries the hallmarks of all of Taraborrelli&#39;s best-sellers: impeccable research, brilliant storytelling and definitive documentation.</p><p>J. Randy Taraborrelli is a respected journalist, a recognizable entertainment personality, and in-demand guest on many television programs including <i>Today, Good Morning America, The Early Show, Entertainment Tonight,</i> and <i>CNN Headline News</i>. He is the bestselling author of thirteen books.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Justin Moyer Did the great flood of words unleashed in the 40 days and 40 nights since the passing of the King of Pop offer new insight into this legend, this plastic surgery disaster, this voice of a generation, this drug-addled man-child? Or was the eulogizing without point or purpose, a rehash of the same stale gossip and well-known stories just to fill airtime and column inches? Michael Jackson, dead at 50, demands a new vocabulary. If Greil Marcus can make Bob Dylan the standard-bearer of American myth in "Invisible Republic" and Nick Tosches can make Jerry Lee Lewis a Gothic antihero in his unforgettable "Hellfire," the rock bio can transcend mere reportage. What writer will now sit down, set aside armchair psychobabble and offer up a real Michael Jackson? Certainly not J. Randy Taraborrelli, who offers this quickly updated version of his 1991 biography as a stand-in for a fresh look at one of the 20th century's greatest entertainers. (The book was updated in 2003 and again in 2004.) A young R&amp;B fanatic who blossomed into a serial celebrity biographer, Taraborrelli met MJ in 1970 when the Jackson 5 was still brushing the dust of Gary, Ind., from the lapels of its matching "lime green vest suits." "The Magic, the Madness, the Whole Story" takes us through the ABCs of Jackson's life that, after last month's orgy of remembrance, are as familiar as "1-2-3": abuse at the hands of a domineering father; fame and fortune at age 10; first rhinoplasty; "Off the Wall"; second rhinoplasty; "Thriller"; Bubbles the chimp; Brooke Shields and Emmanuel Lewis; rumors of homosexuality; "Bad"; Neverland; Lisa Marie; Debbie Rowe; Prince Michael I; rumors of pedophilia; dwindling record sales; arrest for pedophilia; and fatal slide into prescription drug addiction and general quadrillionaire weirdness including, but not limited to, wearing surgical masks in public and consenting to eighth months of interviews with British journalist Martin Bashir. Taraborrelli plays Virgil on the Gloved One's Dantean descent, armed with an enthusiasm for all things Jackson but ill-served by clunky prose. "It is obviously a tragic turn of events if Michael Jackson is being targeted with untrue allegations of child-molestation," he writes in the present tense about the world's most famous dead man. If a publisher slaps 20 pages on to the end of an 18-year-old book and rushes out an "updated edition" less than six weeks after its subject expires, can't a reader expect . . . well . . . the edition to be updated? Still, one can fault Taraborrelli's prose and his publisher's motives, but not his access. As trusted by the mercurial Jackson clan as a reporter can be, the author covered the family from the Nixon to the George W. Bush administrations, documenting every startling triumph and tawdry personal misstep. Taraborrelli relies on lesser, often unnamed players -- music producers, Neverland employees and older brother Jermaine -- to dish dirt, but his own innumerable interviews with Motown's first family lend "Magic" credibility. "I clearly remember the day I wrote 'Michael Jackson Turns 21,' " Taraborrelli boasts. "Then, there was 'Michael Jackson Turns 25' . . . 'Michael Jackson Turns 30.' " If this is hubris, at least it offers relief from watching every reporter who'd ever talked to someone who'd heard of someone who'd interviewed Michael Jackson jockey for five minutes on CNN. But what good is access to an icon if that icon brazenly manipulates the media, and what good are exclusive interviews that provide no real insight? Jackson's otherworldly sexual energy, more than his singing, dancing and songwriting, propelled him to stardom. Fairly or unfairly, what went on under the sheets he shared with pre-adolescent pals overshadows the cultural touchstones of "Motown 25" and "Beat It." If a four-decade media frenzy and a Santa Barbara district attorney can't tell us why Jackson toyed with gender and slept with young boys, can we really know anything about him? Competent reporting at the borders of this mystery isn't enough -- Taraborrelli needs a scoop, a thesis or some hook to hang his narrative on. Anything less is a failure of imagination, and imagination is exactly what this slightly updated biography lacks. Jackson "never seems able to connect the dots of unfolding misery back to his own impulsive actions and questionable judgment," Taraborrelli realizes -- too late to turn it into a theme. By the time the author enters Neverland after Jackson's death to stare into the "Man in the Mirror's" mirror and find only himself -- a mawkish attempt to understand "poor Michael Jackson" -- it's hard to care what lesson he's supposed to be learning. Don DeLillo looked at the Kennedy assassination and gave us "Libra," a nuanced masterpiece that shunned mere protagonists and antagonists to portray conspiracy as incompetence; Curtis Sittenfeld looked at Laura Bush and gave us "American Wife," an unexpectedly gentle depiction of a flawed woman married to a flawed man who had history thrust upon him. These are fictions, but maybe fiction is what the oft-told, unbelievable, unforgettable story of Michael Jackson demands. On his own, he remains shrouded, moonwalking in silhouette. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

It is a story of self-examination, seeking, and selfless service. For more than forty years, Edgar Cayce conducted a work that has been referred to as giving readings. A reading was a discourse given by Cayce while he was lying down, his eyes closed, in an altered state of consciousness. Almost always delivered in his own normal voice, the discourses were recorded stenographically by Gladys Davis Turner and typed immediately. More than fourteen thousand of these readings are now preserved and available for study. They cover such a wide range of subject matter that they are indexed under more than ten thousand major subject headings. They are to be found in the library of the A.R.E. in Virginia Beach, Virginia.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of the readings were given for individuals and, therefore, deal with specific personal questions concerning various aspects of physical, mental, spiritual, vocational, and interpersonal life. Some of these readings, however, were complete discourses on topics such as meditation, Bible interpretation, and world affairs. It was not necessary for the person obtaining the reading to be present: Mr. Cayce was able to describe individuals and diagnose their physical condition with surprising accuracy, even though they might have been hundreds of miles away. Because of these readings, thousands of people were helped, often in ways which transformed their lives. In their entirety, the readings provide specific procedures which are currently helpful in treating many major illnesses. And now, decades after Cayce&#x2019;s death, his readings continue to inspire, educate, and amaze those who research them.<br> &nbsp;<br> This briefly was Edgar Cayce&#x2019;s work. If we take his psychic readings and their accompanying documentation seriously, they will revolutionize our ordinary notions about our sources of information, or how we come by knowledge.<br> &nbsp;<br> How Can We Know?<br> &nbsp;<br> The question, &#x201c;How can we know?&#x201d; is one of the most fundamental concerns of all mankind. Every choice we make is influenced by assumptions we have accepted. Every day we make decisions affecting our health, our business affairs, our relationships with our families and others, our mental and our spiritual attitudes.<br> &nbsp;<br> What are the sources of information upon which we base our decisions? In his search for knowledge, man has turned to many authorities: to a great mind, such as Aristotle&#x2019;s; to divine inspiration, such as the Bible; to personal experience and the physical senses; to reason and to the findings of scientific research.<br> &nbsp;<br> For thousands of years, and especially since the renaissance, our civilization has been deeply influenced by philosophies which maintain that all knowledge originates in the outer world and is mediated by the physical senses. Scientific knowledge is based on this assumption. In contrast, Edgar Cayce, who was really only one exceptional individual among hundreds who have travelled the mystic path, presented solid evidence that information of every kind may be obtained entirely from within.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Edgar Cayce story raises numerous questions about the inner world as a source of information. How does psychic ability relate to us? What are the pitfalls of turning within? What was the source of the information Edgar Cayce gave? What are the steps we should take in evaluating other sources?<br> &nbsp;<br> How Does Psychic Ability Relate to Us?<br> &nbsp;<br> Let us examine for the moment the word &#x201c;psychic&#x201d; which was chosen by the readings to describe this work. Acknowledging that this word could be misconstrued by some, the readings always qualified the definition by stating that &#x201c;psychic is of the soul.&#x201d; Thus the word &#x201c;psychic&#x201d; when referred to in the readings, connotes more than just psychic ability. Since we are all &#x201c;souls,&#x201d; psychic ability as an attribute of the soul, is therefore a potential for everyone.<br> &nbsp;<br> If we are souls with the capacity for psychic awareness that is not limited by time or space, we can conclude, that by attuning ourselves, as souls, to our inner Source, we will find answers to all of our questions, and solutions to what we call problems.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the words of the psalmist, &#x201c;...&nbsp;ye are gods; and all of you are children of the Most High.&#x201d; (Ps. 82:6) As children of God, we are spiritual beings. Therefore, when Edgar Cayce speaks of his work as being &#x201c;psychic&#x201d; and &#x201c;of the soul,&#x201d; he is referring to this essential spiritual relationship which we have with the divine.<br> &nbsp;<br> What Are the Difficulties and Pitfalls of Turning Within?<br> &nbsp;<br> Even though sensitives such as Edgar Cayce seem to be able to tap a Universal source of knowledge, we may find that we are unable to do the same. When we turn within, we often discover instead that we are faced with an array of voices, feelings, impulses, and experiences.<br> &nbsp;<br> What is the problem? Experientially, we discover that the very process through which we seek contact with the highest, may also reveal to us the less worthy side of ourselves: envy, greed, possessiveness&#x2014;aspects of our &#x201c;lower&#x201d; self. Discerning the nature of the inner experience has, therefore, been problematic for thousands of years.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some, who become dismayed by the complexity of this inner world, may oversimplify matters by concluding that information received from within is either from God or the devil. We, as seekers, must be extremely careful to avoid such simplistic evaluations.<br> &nbsp;<br> What Was the Source that Cayce Tapped?<br> &nbsp;<br> The Edgar Cayce readings are especially helpful in achieving an understanding of the complexity of the inner life. They clarify matters by dividing the inner world into three basic states of consciousness. Although the levels of consciousness are perhaps innumerable, the readings deal mainly with the conscious, the subconscious, and the superconscious.<br> &nbsp;<br> This threefold view of the dimensions of consciousness can be illustrated with a cone-shaped diagram.<br> &nbsp;<br> The opening of the cone represents the superconscious, or the access to the Divine, if you will&#x2014;man&#x2019;s spiritual promise as a soul with unlimited awareness. This level of consciousness, according to the readings, was Edgar Cayce&#x2019;s source of psychic information. The point of the cone represents the physical consciousness which is limited in awareness by the here-and-now requirements of the physical body and its senses. The subconscious, which is evident especially in our dreams and spontaneous urgings, acts as a filter or mediator between the infinite potential of the superconscious and the finite limitations of the waking conscious.<br> &nbsp;<br> The concept of the subconscious as a dynamic process between normal physical consciousness and the super-conscious potential is the key to a fuller understanding of the array of inner experiences available to us. As a mediator, the subconscious may either enhance or distort man&#x2019;s access to the divine within. Information coming from the superconscious filters through the thought forms and desire patterns of the subconscious. Therefore, it may be accurate or inaccurate, helpful or harmful, pure or distorted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Based on the above threefold model, an individual may be said to be psychic to the degree that he is able to put aside the distracting input from the conscious and subconscious in preference to input from the superconscious, which may put him in touch with all worthwhile information. For a channel to be consistently accurate and helpful, then, one must be able to tap the superconscious on a regular basis. And this Edgar Cayce did with remarkable frequency and consistency.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ability to establish and maintain a helpful input from the superconscious is dependent upon many factors. It is affected by the general physical health and the degree of momentary attunement of the physical body of the channel. It involves the thoughts, emotions, and desires of the channel. It depends on the channel&#x2019;s deep-seated conception of the source he intends to tap. And it is influenced by the purposes, motivations, and ideals of the channel.<br> &nbsp;<br> Considering such a model of consciousness and the complex role of the subconscious as the mediator between out conscious mind and the Divine, we can begin to understand and properly appreciate the problem of obtaining information from psychic sources.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Need for Outside Sources<br> &nbsp;<br> We must also turn outside of ourselves for Information. If we have begun to center ourselves by establishing an ideal and by attuning ourselves through meditation, then we can respond constructively to outside sources. Everyone relies to some extent upon externally obtained information.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is an excellent example in the Old Testament about external sources of information. Shortly before receiving the ten commandments, Moses was visited by his father-in-law, Jethro. Moses recounted to him in full detail all the ways in which God, working through Moses, manifested Himself in the events surrounding the Exodus. The next day Moses sat to judge the people, who had waited from morning till evening. Jethro perceived the inefficiency of this procedure and intimated that Moses should appoint assistants to aid him in judging. Moses gave heed to his father-in-law and did all that he suggested (Exodus 18). Thus Moses, one of the greatest and most direct channels for the word of God, was confident enough to recognize and act upon a good idea from an external source. Like Moses, we need to be open to God working through those around us, since they, too, have access to the Divine within.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Alexander Hamilton&#39;s Guide to Life</h2><p><b><b>The life&#x2014;and lessons&#x2014;of the Founding Father who mastered the arts of wit, war, and wealth, long<i>&nbsp;</i>before becoming&nbsp;the subject of Broadway&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Hamilton: An American Musical<br></i></b><br> </b>Two centuries after his death, Alexander Hamilton is shining once more under the world&#x2019;s spotlight&#x2014;and we need him now more than ever.&nbsp;<br><br> Hamilton was a self-starter.

He lives in New York.<p>&#x201c;[I] would willingly risk my life tho&#x2019; not my Character to exalt my Station.&#x201d;</p><p>Hamilton&#x2019;s early years are murky. Historians debate the details. Yet there can be no doubt that he&#x2019;s the only Founding Father whose mother, Rachael Fawcett, was accused in court of &#x201c;whoring with everyone.&#x201d;</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t a happy home. This wasn&#x2019;t a happy place. On the Caribbean island of St. Croix, several years before Hamilton&#x2019;s birth, Rachael was &#x201c;twice guilty of adultery,&#x201d; according to her first husband, which, in those enlightened times, gave him the legal right to toss her into prison. So he locked her in a dungeon. (I&#x2019;ve been inside the prison cell. It&#x2019;s dark, hot, and has a tiny window that looks out on the clear blue sea, almost as a taunt.)</p><p>With Rachael behind bars, her husband hoped that &#x201c;everything would change to the better and that she, as a wedded wife, would change her unholy way of life and live with him.&#x201d; Ah, true love! He let her out of jail. Somehow the plan backfired, the dungeon failed to melt her heart, and Rachael fled and didn&#x2019;t look back.</p><p>She took a ferry to an even smaller island, St. Kitts, that throbbed with the sugar and slave trades. She met a Scot named James Hamilton. On an even smaller island, Nevis, Rachael gave birth to two boys, one named Alexander. She was still married to the dungeon-master of a first husband, however, which meant that Alexander Hamilton, technically, was born a bastard. The first husband eventually filed for a separation; the divorce papers called her &#x201c;shameless, rude and ungodly&#x201d; and the mother of &#x201c;whorechildren.&#x201d;</p><p>The family soon moved back to St. Croix. The island was brutal. Alexander, or Alex, as he was called as a toddler, grew up in a land that had 90 percent of its population chained in slavery. The slaves made the sugar. &#x201c;The whites lived in fear of slave rebellions. By law, every white man had to be armed with a gun, sixteen cartridges with balls, and a sword or cutlass,&#x201d; explains biographer James Flexner. &#x201c;To keep terror perpetually alive among the blacks, it was legislated that if a slave struck a white man, he would lose the hand he struck it with. If he drew blood, he could be executed.&#x201d;</p><p>Then things took a turn for the worse.</p><p>Alex&#x2019;s father went bankrupt and left home. (Historians still aren&#x2019;t sure why.) Then the family got sick. Rachael caught tropical fever, confining her to a bed that would drip with blood, sweat, and vomit. The house had only one bed, which meant that Alex either slept next to his coughing mother or he slept on the floor. The doctors treated Rachael with &#x201c;bloodletting&#x201d; and &#x201c;alcohol for her head.&#x201d; He was eleven when she died. The probate court ruled that Alex would get nothing from her modest estate, as he and his brother were &#x201c;obscene children.&#x201d;</p><p>Then things took a turn for the worse.</p><p>Alex&#x2019;s cousin volunteered to look after the boys, but for reasons still unknown he committed suicide. The legal record states that he &#x201c;stabbed or shot himself to death.&#x201d; His grandmother died. His uncle died. His aunt died.</p><p>Yet Alex refused to think like a victim. When he was just twelve years old, he wrote to his friend Edward Stevens (or &#x201c;Neddy&#x201d;), declaring:</p><p>My Ambition is [so] prevalent that I contemn the grov&#x2019;ling and condition of a Clerk . . . to which my Fortune condemns me and would willingly risk my life tho&#x2019; not my Character to exalt my Station.</p><p>He ends the letter on one of history&#x2019;s great non sequiturs: &#x201c;I shall conclude saying I wish there was a war.&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s Hamilton&#x2019;s oldest surviving letter. Even as a child he burned with a desire to do whatever it takes--work harder, get smarter, prove valor on a battlefield--to improve himself . . . so long as it did not compromise his honor.</p><p>There&#x2019;s one more lesson here. The letter contains another, trickier, more archaic passage that isn&#x2019;t quoted as often:</p><p>I&#x2019;m confident, Ned that my youth excludes me from any hopes of immediate preferment nor do I desire it, but I mean to prepare the way for futurity . . . My folly makes me ashamed and [I] beg you&#x2019;ll conceal it, yet Neddy we have seen such schemes successful when the Projector is constant.</p><p>Okay, some real talk: On the first read, that paragraph is nearly incomprehensible. Yet it contains the keys to Hamilton&#x2019;s playbook. Douglas Hamilton (the fifth great-grandson) thinks of this advice all the time, he lives by it, and he shares it with his grandchildren, who are often baffled. &#x201c;People ask me, Projector? What the hell does that even mean?&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#x2019;s look at the sentence again:&nbsp;</p><p>. . . we have seen such schemes successful when the Projector is constant . . .</p><p>&nbsp;The Projector is the thing that is projecting an outcome, the thing doing the work. You. If the projector is constant--with steady work--then you can prepare yourself for a better future. This is how you rise above your station.&nbsp;</p><p>He had no parents, no inheritance, no formal education, and no obvious path to success. Yet he knew it was possible. He believed. From the very beginning, it would always be Alexander Hamilton against the world.</p><p>That&#x2019;s a fair fight.</p><p>Steal (New Skills) from Every Job&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;[A childhood job in a trading shop was] the most useful part of [my] education.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>Think back to your first job. Maybe it was delivering pizzas, waiting tables, or sacking groceries. Hamilton had a job like that. When his mom was still alive he helped her run a shop below their home, and then, when still a kid (possibly as young as eight), he worked at a trading shop called Beekman and Cruger. It&#x2019;s the kind of job that most kids hate. He must have swept the floors, wiped the counters, and spent hours tediously double-checking the inventory.</p><p>Yet the job offered something more. For perhaps the first time in his life, Hamilton began to glimpse a larger world. Some quick context: When people say that Hamilton was from &#x201c;a forgotten spot&#x201d; or &#x201c;the middle of nowhere,&#x201d; that&#x2019;s not entirely true. Every morning, as a fleet of ships hugged the wharfs of St. Croix, he woke up to a bustling commercial hub. Sugar was to the Caribbean what oil now is to the Middle East. The &#x201c;white gold&#x201d; could make or break empires. (How valuable was the Caribbean? In the treaty of 1763, after a military defeat, France was forced to give Britain either most of Canada or the tiny islands of Martinique, Guadeloupe, and St. Lucia. They thought about it for maybe five seconds. Then they kissed Canada goodbye.)</p><p>Hamilton saw all of the wheeling and dealing. Since the shop traded with all parts of the globe, it forced him to learn about things like foreign exchange rates and currency fluctuations--French livres, German marks, Danish kroner. He learned bookkeeping. Inventory control. When cargo sailed to the docks of St. Croix, young Hamilton unloaded the goods and lugged them to a Scale House, where he measured the lumber, pork, fish, rope, cattle, and corn. (The Scale House still exists. And it&#x2019;s only a Frisbee toss away from where his mother was once imprisoned, which means he saw the jail every day.) He did his chores well. So his boss, the Dickensian-named Nicholas Cruger, soon gave him more clout: Alex would decide where the cargo should be sold, when to sell it, and how much it should cost.</p><p>&#x201c;The when to sell sounds obvious, but it&#x2019;s not always,&#x201d; explains historian Michael E. Newton. Hamilton once inspected a boatload of scrawny mules. &#x201c;A worse parcel of mules never was seen,&#x201d; reported Hamilton. The easy move would have been to sell the mules right away and be done with it. Instead he fed them, waited for them to grow healthier, and then sold them at a higher profit.</p><p>He learned supply and demand, price elasticity, and the art of negotiation. This gave him an early nose for global finance. (Meanwhile, far away in the thirteen colonies, his eventual rivals would go through puberty learning a much simpler economic model: Watch your slaves pick cotton. Sell. Pour more lemonade.)</p><p>As a clerk, Hamilton had to haggle with scoundrels and smugglers, which taught him another life lesson--people cheat--that would, years later, spawn his idea for a fleet of boats that would curb smuggling (the fleet would become the Coast Guard). The job also taught him the need for a solid currency. And he learned that every business needs access to cash, capital, and credit.</p><p>The &#x201c;steal new skills&#x201d; mentality, of course, doesn&#x2019;t mean that you need to love your tedious job. Not even Hamilton pretended to, complaining to Neddy of the &#x201c;grov&#x2019;ling . . . condition of a clerk.&#x201d; But flip the mindset. Learn from the job. Exploit it. Fill your bag of skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Not even dead-end jobs are a dead end.</p><p><br>When Was Hamilton Born?</p><p>Nothing about Alexander Hamilton is ever simple. Not even his birthday. Everyone agrees on the date of January 11, but historians debate the year itself.</p><p>For nearly two hundred years, most scholars accepted that Hamilton was born in 1757. One key bit of evidence? Hamilton himself cited 1757 as his birth year. Then, in 1939, a newly discovered document, from a St. Croix probate court, pointed to a birth year of 1755.</p><p>Academics and historians have spent years and hundreds of pages digging through the weeds, but basically, it comes down to one of two things. Either:</p><p>1) Hamilton lied about his age; or</p><p>2) The clerk made a mistake.</p><p>The &#x201c;Hamilton lied&#x201d; camp suggests that when he enrolled in college, he deliberately shaved two years off his age to appear more like a prodigy. The &#x201c;clerk erred&#x201d; camp notes that on the very same document, the clerk misspelled the name of Hamilton&#x2019;s mother. As Brookhiser concludes, &#x201c;Believing that a man is more likely to know his own birthday than a clerk in a probate court, I will accept 1757.&#x201d; Same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read When Others Play&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;[Employ] all your leisure in reading.&#x201d;</p><p>The &#x201c;Reading Is Fundamental&#x201d; campaign could begin and end with Alexander Hamilton. Books were the fuel that made his engine go. And his love of reading started at a young age. We don&#x2019;t know much about Hamilton&#x2019;s mother, but we do know that she had a library of thirty-four books, a stash that likely included Machiavelli, Plutarch, and Alexander Pope. You know, kids&#x2019; books.</p><p>He ripped through these. He ripped through every library. He devoured classics, novels, poetry, philosophy, history, and fat economic treatises that would make you and me weep. Yet this is what set Hamilton apart: he carved out time to read when others wouldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Years later, as a young man in Washington&#x2019;s army, while burdened by a dawn-to-dusk schedule of artillery and bloodshed, he somehow found the energy to crack open books and improve himself. Who else would spend his downtime reading Malachy Postlethwayt&#x2019;s Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce? The book was large and heavy and wasn&#x2019;t available on the Kindle. &#x201c;The dictionary took the form of two ponderous, folio-sized volumes,&#x201d; notes Ron Chernow, &#x201c;and it is touching to think of young Hamilton lugging them through the chaos of war.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of playing cards with the other officers, Hamilton would cozy up with this almanac and think about its content, scribbling notes in his journal like, &#x201c;When you can get more of foreign coin, [the] coin of your native exchange is said to be high and the reverse low.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>The reading paid off immediately. Still ensconced in Washington&#x2019;s command center, the young officer wrote a bold letter to a congressman that flashed, for the first time, the glimmer of his financial brilliance. &#x201c;The present plan is the product of some reading on the subjects of commerce and finance,&#x201d; he wrote with some understatement, and a &#x201c;want of leisure&#x201d; prevented him from writing even more. Young Hamilton&#x2019;s &#x201c;present plan&#x201d; was a six-thousand-word, twelve-point program that foreshadowed his grand designs as treasury secretary.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t have to be a freakishly gifted Founding Father (or Mother) to benefit from this mindset. Some basic math will help us bridge from Hamilton legend to something that&#x2019;s doable: The average reading speed is 250 words per minute. The average page has around 250 words. So if you skip just one TV show and read for just one hour every day, that works out to 420 pages a week, or, on average, 50 books a year. Over, say, 40 years of adulthood, that adds up to a sprawling, floor-to-ceiling library of over 2,000 books. It can be done.</p><p>Hamilton knew that books can worm their way into your brain in surprising ways, sparking ideas that power the imagination. The examples are infinite, such as the time in 2008 when, on the way to a vacation in Mexico, an artist picked up a book to read on the beach. Thankfully this artist was Lin-Manuel Miranda, and thankfully the book was Ron Chernow&#x2019;s Alexander Hamilton.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Speak with Authority . . . Even if You Have None</p><p>&#x201c;Reflect continually on the unfortunate voyage you have just made.&#x201d;</p><p>Hamilton&#x2019;s boss at the trading shop, Nicholas Cruger, soon grew to trust the kid. So when the boss had to leave the shop for a few months, he put Hamilton in charge.</p><p>At age fourteen, Hamilton immediately acted like he owned the place. He instructed one captain to &#x201c;remember you are to make three trips this season and unless you are very diligent, you will be too late as our crops will be early.&#x201d; Later, when someone botched a job, young Hamilton admonished him to &#x201c;reflect continually on the unfortunate voyage you have just made.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>The kid wrote like a seasoned Wall Street trader: &#x201c;I sold all your lumber off immediately at 16 pounds. Luckily enough, the price of that article being now reduced to 12 pounds . . . Your mahogany is of the very worst kind.&#x201d; No timidity, no indecisiveness, no signs of backing down. When a man&#x2019;s mahogany isn&#x2019;t up to snuff, you call him on it.&nbsp;</p><p>While his boss was away, Hamilton even had the audacity to fire the shop&#x2019;s lawyer, as he was &#x201c;very negligent . . . and trifled away a good deal of money.&#x201d;</p><p>Years later, in the Revolutionary War, Hamilton&#x2019;s nervy tone would earn the respect of senior officers and politicians. When still a junior secretary, he wrote to a brigadier general that Washington was &#x201c;so much pestered with matters which cannot be avoided that I am obliged to refrain from troubling him . . . especially as I conceive the only answer he would give may be given by myself.&#x201d; Translation: You will take your orders from me.</p><p>At nearly every stage of Hamilton&#x2019;s career, from age eight until the day he died, he would, almost without exception, be the youngest man in the room. He made up for his youth with an assertive voice. You get the sense that when Hamilton came out of the womb, he somehow told his mother, &#x201c;I am ready for the milk. Please do not be frugal. When I finish, you should prepare yourself for subsequent feedings.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Down and Dirty Guide to Camping with Kids: How to Plan Memorable Family Adventures and Connect Kids to Nature</h2><p>Plan your family camping adventure! <br><br>Whether you&#x2019;re a first-time camper or a veteran backpacker befuddled by the challenges of carting a brood&#x2014;and all the requisite gear&#x2014;into the great outdoors, here you&#x2019;ll find all the tips and tools you need to plan the perfect nature adventure with your family.

During the Second World War, the inhabitants of this tiny mountain village and its parishes saved thousands wanted by the Gestapo: resisters, freemasons, communists, OSS and SOE agents, and Jews.

A serious little girl pouring out meal for the baby chickens or collecting the fresh eggs each day, always saying &#x201c;chuck, chuck, chuck&#x201d; soothingly into the feathers as she worked. Chicky had names for all the hens, and no one could tell her when one had been taken to provide a Sunday lunch. They always pretended it was a shop chicken, but Chicky always knew.<br><br>Stoneybridge was a paradise for children during the summer, but summer in the West of Ireland was short, and most of the time it was wet and wild and lonely on the Atlantic coast. Still, there were caves to explore, cliffs to climb, birds&#x2019; nests to discover, and wild sheep with great curly horns to investigate. And then there was Stone House. Chicky loved to play in its huge overgrown garden. Sometimes the Miss Sheedys, three sisters who owned the house and were ancient, let her play at dressing up in their old clothes.<br><br>Chicky watched as Kathleen went off to train to be a nurse in a big hospital in Wales, and then Mary got a job in an insurance office. Neither of those jobs appealed to Chicky at all, but she would have to do something. The land wouldn&#x2019;t support the whole Ryan family. Two of the boys had gone to serve their time in business in big towns in the West. Only Brian would work with his father.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s mother was always tired and her father always worried. They were relieved when Chicky got a job in the knitting factory. Not as a machinist or home knitter but in the office. She was in charge of sending out the finished garments to customers and keeping the books. It wasn&#x2019;t a great job but it did mean that she could stay at home, which was what she wanted. She had plenty of friends around the place, and each summer she fell in love with a different O&#x2019;Hara boy but nothing ever came of it.<br><br>Then one day Walter Starr, a young American, wandered into the knitting factory wanting to buy an Aran sweater. Chicky was instructed to explain to him that the factory was not a retail outlet, they only made up sweaters for stores or mail order.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re missing a trick then,&#x201d; Walter Starr said. &#x201c;People come to this wild place and they need an Aran sweater, and they need it now, not in a few weeks&#x2019; time.&#x201d;<br><br>He was very handsome. He reminded her of how Jack and Bobby Kennedy had looked when they were boys, same flashing smile and good teeth. He was suntanned and very different from the boys around Stoneybridge. She didn&#x2019;t want him to leave the knitting factory and he didn&#x2019;t seem to want to go either.<br><br>Chicky remembered a sweater they had in stock, which they had used to be photographed. Perhaps Walter Starr might like to buy that one&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t exactly new but it was nearly new.<br><br>He said it would be perfect.<br><br>He invited her to go for a walk on the beach, and he told her this was one of the most beautiful places on earth.<br><br>Imagine! He had been to California and Italy and yet he thought Stoneybridge was beautiful.<br><br>And he thought Chicky was beautiful too. He said she was just so cute with her dark curly hair and her big blue eyes. They spent every possible moment together. He had intended to stay only a day or two, but now he found it hard to go on anywhere else. Unless she would come with him, of course.<br><br>Chicky laughed out loud at the idea that she should pack in her job at the knitting factory and tell her mother and father that she was going around Ireland hitchhiking with an American that she had just met! It would have been more acceptable to suggest flying to the moon.<br><br>Walter found her horror at the idea touching and almost endearing.<br><br>&#x201c;We only have one life, Chicky. They can&#x2019;t live it for us. We have to live it ourselves. Do you think my parents want me out here in the wilds of nowhere, having a good time? No, they want me in the country club playing tennis with the daughters of nice families, but, hey, this is where I want to be. It&#x2019;s as simple as that.&#x201d;<br><br>Walter Starr lived in a world where everything was simple. They loved each other, so what was more natural than to make love? They each knew the other was right, so why complicate their lives by fretting over what other people would say or think or do? A kindly God understood love. Father Johnson, who had taken a vow never to fall in love, didn&#x2019;t. They didn&#x2019;t need any stupid contracts or certificates, did they?<br><br>And after six glorious weeks, when Walter had to think of going back to the States, Chicky was ready to go with him. It involved an immense amount of rows and dramas and enormous upset in the Ryan household. But Walter was unaware of any of this.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s father was more worried than ever now because everyone would say that he had brought up a tramp who was no better than she should be.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s mother looked more tired and disappointed than ever, and said only God and his sainted mother knew what she had done wrong in bringing Chicky up to be such a scourge to them all.<br><br>Kathleen said that it was just as well she had an engagement ring on her finger because no man would have her if he knew the kind of family she came from.<br><br>Mary, who worked in the insurance office and was walking out with one of the O&#x2019;Haras, said that the days of her romance were now numbered, thanks to Chicky. The O&#x2019;Haras were a very respectable family in the town, and they wouldn&#x2019;t think kindly about this behavior at all.<br><br>Her brother Brian kept his head down and said nothing at all. When Chicky asked him what he thought, Brian said he didn&#x2019;t think. He didn&#x2019;t have time to think.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;Peggy, who also worked in the knitting factory, and Nuala, who was a maid for the three Miss Sheedys&#x2014;said it was the most exciting, reckless thing they had ever heard of, and wasn&#x2019;t it great that she had a passport already from that school trip to Lourdes.<br><br>Walter Starr said they would stay in New York with friends of his. He was going to drop out of law school&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t really right for him. If we had several lives, well then, yes, maybe, but since we only have one life it wasn&#x2019;t worth spending it studying law.<br><br>The night before she left, Chicky tried to make her parents understand her feelings She was twenty, she had her whole life to live, she wanted to love her family and for them to love her in spite of their disappointment.<br><br>Her father&#x2019;s face was tight and hard. She would never be welcome in this house again, she had brought shame on them all.<br><br>Her mother was bitter. She said that Chicky was being very, very foolish. It wouldn&#x2019;t last, it couldn&#x2019;t last. It was not love, it was infatuation. If this Walter really loved her, then he would wait for her and provide her with a home and his name and a future instead of all this nonsense.<br><br>You could cut the atmosphere in the Ryan household with a knife.<br><br>Chicky&#x2019;s sisters were no support. But she was adamant. They hadn&#x2019;t known real love. She was not going to change her plans. She had her passport. She was going to go to America.<br><br>&#x201c;Wish me well,&#x201d; she had begged them the night before she left, but they had turned their faces away.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let me go away with the memory of you being so cold.&#x201d; Chicky had tears running down her face.<br><br>Her mother sighed a great sigh. &#x201c;It would be cold if we just said, &#x2018;Go ahead, enjoy yourself.&#x2019; We are trying to do our best for you. To help you make the best of your life. This is not love, it&#x2019;s only some sort of infatuation. There&#x2019;s no use pretending. You can&#x2019;t have our blessing. It&#x2019;s just not there for you.&#x201d;<br><br>So Chicky left without it.<br><br>At Shannon Airport there were crowds waving good-bye to their children setting out for a new life in the United States. There was nobody to wave Chicky good-bye, but she and Walter didn&#x2019;t care. They had their whole life ahead of them.<br><br>No rules, no doing the right thing to please the neighbors and relations.<br><br>They would be free&#x2014;free to work where they wanted and at what they wanted.<br><br>No trying to fulfill other people&#x2019;s hopes&#x2014;to marry a rich farmer, in Chicky&#x2019;s case, or to become a top lawyer, which was what Walter&#x2019;s family had in mind for him.<br><br>Walter&#x2019;s friends were welcoming in the big apartment in Brooklyn. Young people, friendly and easygoing. Some worked in bookshops, some in bars. Others were musicians. They came and went easily. Nobody made any fuss. It was so very different from home. A couple came in from the Coast, and a girl from Chicago who wrote poetry. There was a Mexican boy who played the guitar in Latino bars.<br><br>Everyone was so relaxed. Chicky found it amazing. Nobody made any demands. They would make a big chili for supper with everyone helping. There was no pressure.<br><br>They sighed a bit about their families not understanding anything, but it didn&#x2019;t weigh heavily on anyone. Soon Chicky felt Stoneybridge fade away a little. However, she wrote a letter home every week. She had decided from the outset that she would not be the one to keep a feud going.<br><br>If one side behaved normally, then sooner or later the other side would have to respond and behave normally as well.<br><br>She did hear from some of her friends, and had the odd bit of news from them. Peggy and Nuala wrote and told her about life back home; it didn&#x2019;t seem to have changed much in any way at all. So she was able to write to say she was delighted about the plans for Kathleen&#x2019;s wedding to Mikey, and did not mention that she had heard about Mary&#x2019;s romance with Sonny O&#x2019;Hara having ended.<br><br>Her mother wrote brisk little cards, asking whether she had fixed a date for her wedding yet and wondering about whether there were Irish priests in the parish.<br><br>She told them nothing about the communal life she lived in the big crowded apartment, with all the coming and going and guitar playing. They would never have been able to begin to understand.<br><br>Instead, she wrote about going to art-exhibit openings and theater first nights. She read about these in the papers, and sometimes indeed she and Walter went to matinees or got cheap seats at previews through friends of friends who wanted to fill a house.<br><br>Walter had a job helping to catalog a library for some old friends of his parents. His family had hoped to woo him back this way to some form of academic life, he said, and it wasn&#x2019;t a bad job. They left him alone and didn&#x2019;t give him any hassle. That&#x2019;s all anyone wanted in life.<br><br>Chicky learned that this was definitely all Walter wanted in life. So she didn&#x2019;t nag him about when she would meet his parents, or when they would find a place of their own, or indeed what they would do down the line. They were together in New York. That was enough, wasn&#x2019;t it?<br><br>And in many ways it was.<br><br>Chicky got herself a job in a diner. The hours suited her. She could get up very early, leave the apartment before anyone else was awake. She helped open up the diner, did her shift and served breakfasts. She was back at the apartment before the others had struggled into the day, bringing them cold milk and bagels left over from the diner&#x2019;s breakfast stock. They got used to her bringing them their supplies. She still heard news from home but it became more and more remote.</p><h2>Emmy and the Home for Troubled Girls (Emmy and the Rat, 2)</h2><p><p><b>In the irresistible sequel to <i>Emmy and the Incredible Shrinking Rat</i>, Emmy, Joe, and Ratty rescue other children Miss Barmy has preyed upon</b></p><p>Emmy Addison is an ordinary girl -- almost.

Miss Barmy is now a rat. How much harm can she do?</p></p><p><p><b>Lynne Jonell</b> is the author of the novels <i>Emmy and the Incredible Shrinking Rat</i> and <i>The Secret of Zoom</i>, as well as several critically acclaimed picture books.

He has illustrated several books for young readers, including <i>Mokie and Bik</i>. He lives in New York City.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p><p>Emmy Addison was an ordinary girl&#x2014;almost. </p><p>She had straight dark hair, skinny legs with a scrape on one knee, and no particular talent that she knew of. If you didn&#x2019;t count the fact that her parents were rich (very), her best friend was a boy (and a soccer star), and she could talk to rodents (and they talked back), she was very ordinary indeed. </p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t been ordinary for long, but even just a few weeks were enough to convince her that she didn&#x2019;t want to be any other way. Since the middle of May, her teacher had actually remembered her name at school. The other kids had played with her at recess. And her parents had eaten supper with her, and asked how her day had been, and reminded her to brush her teeth, in the most normal way possible.</p><p>Emmy didn&#x2019;t want it to end. </p><p>So she made a list of all the things an ordinary ten and a half year old should do during the summer. She posted it beside her bedroom window&#x2014;the one in the turret&#x2014;and she&#x2019;d already managed to cross the first thing off the list. &#x201c;Build a tree fort,&#x201d; it said; and just yesterday, she and her friend Joe had finished the best tree fort ever. </p><p>It was high&#x2014;too high, her mother had worried, but her father had checked it for sturdiness, added a brace, and pronounced it safe. It was tucked snugly between three branches of the tallest oak in the woods behind Emmy&#x2019;s house, and from its platform she could look out over Grayson Lake and see sailboats skimming on Loon&#x2019;s Bay. Just now, though, she was flat on her stomach with her head hanging over the edge, watching Joe sprint up the path.</p><p>&#x201c;Hiya!&#x201d; Joe skidded to a stop beneath the big oak, a pale haired boy in a blue soccer jersey and grass stained shorts, and grinned up at Emmy, waiting. </p><p>&#x201c;Password?&#x201d; Emmy demanded. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah. Um... Rat Fink?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No, that was yesterday&#x2019;s.&#x201d; Emmy propped her chin on her forearms.</p><p>Joe scratched his freckled nose. &#x201c;Hamster Hocks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last week&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>Joe shot a glance over his shoulder. &#x201c;Come on, Emmy. I dodged my little brother two blocks ago, but he&#x2019;s faster on his pudgy feet than he used to be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s &#x2018;Mouse Droppings,&#x2019; Emmy said resignedly, throwing down one end of the rope ladder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think you could remember a password you thought up yourself.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sorr-<em>ry</em>.&#x201d; said Joe, grabbing the rope. &#x201c; I&#x2019;ve remembered a message for you, though.&#x201d;</p><p>Emmy looked down at him warily. &#x201c;Who from?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Bunjee.&#x201d;</p><p>Emmy winced inwardly. How many girls, she wondered, got messages from chipmunks?</p><p>&#x201c;She asked,&#x201d; Joe added, swaying as he climbed, &#x201c;why you haven&#x2019;t come to visit. She has a new recipe for acorn soup, and says you&#x2019;re welcome anytime.&#x201d;</p><p>Emmy felt uncomfortable. It wasn&#x2019;t that she didn&#x2019;t feel grateful to the rodents who had helped her. Without the chipmunks, and the Rat, and all the rest, she would never have been able to get rid of Miss Barmy, the nanny who had nearly ruined her life.</p><p>But girls who visited chipmunks were&#x2014;well, <em>weird</em>. It was okay for Joe; he was popular, he was the best athlete in the school, and everyone had known him since kindergarten; but for Emmy it was different. </p><p>She had been new at Grayson Lake Elementary last fall, when her parents had moved to the stone mansion on Loon&#x2019;s Bay. That was hard enough, but then Miss Barmy had used some unusual rodents to make Emmy&#x2019;s classmates, her teacher, and even her own parents forget that she existed. Emmy hadn&#x2019;t understood why her parents had suddenly seemed to stop caring about her, or why all her attempts to make friends at school met with a blank stare.</p><p>If she hadn&#x2019;t discovered that Raston Rat, their fourth grade class pet, had unusual powers, too; if she and Joe hadn&#x2019;t become friends, and shrunk to rat-size; if they hadn&#x2019;t gone underground to Rodent City, where they joined forces with Professor Capybara and the chipmunks; then Miss Barmy might have succeeded in her plan to get rid of Emmy&#x2019;s parents, steal their money, and lock Emmy up for good in the Home for Troubled Girls.</p><p>But all had turned out well. Miss Barmy and her sidekick, Cheswick Vole, had been changed into rats themselves, Emmy&#x2019;s parents had become loving once more, and the kids at school had been as friendly as could be expected towards a girl they thought they&#x2019;d just met. Still, though Emmy had had several weeks of being an ordinary kid, she had a lot of catching up to do before fifth grade.</p><p>She wanted to do regular ten year old things&#x2014;go to birthday parties, and have sleepovers, and swim and bike and jump off swings in the park. She wanted to start fifth grade with a <em>hundred</em> friends&#x2014;or at any rate, more than one or two. She was going to be too busy this summer to spend time with a bunch of rodents, because she absolutely refused to go through another school year feeling lonely and invisible. </p><p>And of course there were a few more reasons why she wasn&#x2019;t keen on visiting Rodent City. </p><p>The treehouse creaked as Joe clambered over the edge. &#x201c;Free at last!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Did you win your game?&#x201d; Emmy gazed idly at her house through the leaves, and her window in the topmost turret. </p><p>&#x201c;Both games,&#x201d; said Joe gloomily. &#x201c;So now we have to play two more tomorrow before the championship.&#x201d; He rolled on his back to toss twigs at the large branch that overhung the platform. &#x201c;At least I don&#x2019;t have to go to California on Monday. The soccer camp Dad tried to sign me up for was full.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re sick of playing soccer,&#x201d; said Emmy reasonably, &#x201c;just stop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t want to play. I just don&#x2019;t want to play every stupid day all year long, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; Joe sat up abruptly, his eye caught by a knothole above him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s funny,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but ever since that stuff happened&#x2014;you know, shrinking and all&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>Emmy nodded impatiently. Of course she knew.</p><p>&#x201c;I like to check out every rat-sized crack I see.&#x201d; He chinned himself on the overhanging branch and pressed his eye to the hole.</p><p>Emmy leaned back. &#x201c;Can you see anything?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Too dark. Next time I&#x2019;ll bring a flashlight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We should have a box up here for that kind of stuff. Flashlights&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And batteries,&#x201d; added Joe, dropping down with a thump.</p><p>&#x201c;Hammer and nails,&#x201d; Emmy said, &#x201c;and bandaids.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Comic books.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Regular books too,&#x201d; said Emmy, &#x201c;especially ones about sailing&#x2014;like <em>Swallows and Amazons</em>&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;An astronomy book, so we can steer by the stars.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a telescope!&#x201d; Emmy sat up. &#x201c;We could use it for a spyglass&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And look out for pirates&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And buried treasure!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll make the pirates walk the plank, or&#x2014;&#x201d; Joe gripped his throat with both hands, &#x201c;&#x2014;hang them from the yardarm.&#x201d;</p><p>Emmy rolled over to the edge, feeling for the ladder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get the spyglass.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get a bottle of ginger ale&#x2014;no, grog,&#x201d; Joe called, &#x201c;and we can christen the ship!&#x201d;</p><p>Emmy slammed the kitchen door behind her, sprinted up the stairs and nearly collided with Maggie on the second floor land</p></p><h2>Writing Treatments That Sell: How to Create and Market Your Story Ideas to the Motion Picture and TV Industry, Second Edition</h2><p><p><b>A fully revised guide to turning your movie idea into a treatment that can persuade even the most jaded movie producers</b></p><p>As Hollywood insiders know, the first step in selling your story idea for film or television is preparing a treatment, the brief pitch that sells the concept to a busy producer or agent.

This new sixth edition has been thoroughly updated throughout and offers new material on everything from adventure tours to accommodation, environmental change to restaurants. Also covered are the restoration of Barentsburg and the opening of Svalbard's historic mine to visitors. Newly updated and amended, this edition reflects important recent changes in the archipelago, making it the perfect guide to a quintessential bucket-list destination.Possibly the most remote destination in the developed world, Svalbard is the planet's most northerly settled land and the top (if not the end) of the world, and it was on and around Svalbard that most of David Attenborough's Frozen Planet was filmed. A trip to Svalbard easily lends itself to notching up geographic superlatives and adventurous travellers seek out experiences such as husky driving and hikes across the permafrost. The main tourist period falls in Svalbard's brief summer, from June to August, when it's light around the clock and not very cold. However, increasingly popular for winter sports &#x2013; especially because the next few years will enjoy unusually high Northern Lights activity &#x2013; are the so-called &#x2018;light winter' months (March&#x2013;May), when there is both sunlight and snow. The winter season (November/December&#x2013;March) offers many possibilities for outdoor adventure &#x2013; and the polar night is an experience in itself. Despite winter temperatures that can drop to over 40 below zero, Svalbard's glorious mountains, majestic fjords and sprawling valleys are the perfect setting for adventurous journeys out to the back of beyond. This brand-new edition of Svalbard provides all of the practical and background information you'll need to explore this wild place, turning the hostile into the hospitable.<br></p><p>James Proctor first came across all things Nordic as a student. After mistakenly wandering into a Swedish lecture, he soon realised that his native Yorkshire dialect, liberally laced with dozens of old Viking words, was going to make learning this offbeat Scandinavian language a doddle. And so began a love affair with the Nordic countries, which has endured to this day &#x2013; 30 years or so later. As the BBC's Scandinavia correspondent in the 90s, James travelled widely across the Nordic countries and has since written no fewer than six travel guides to the region. He first visited Svalbard in 2017 and, despite his knowledge of northern countries, was still struck by the fact that it takes a full 1ï¿½ hours by jet-engined 737 to reach Svalbard from northernmost Lapland. A trip to Svalbard will always be one of those once-in-a-lifetime adventures and James is glad to count himself among the members of this still rather exclusive club who have made it to the High Arctic. Today he divides his time between the South of France and his beloved Yorkshire.Anika Paust left her studies in Aerospace Engineering to travel the world, but ended up in the tiny town of Longyearbyen just 1,300km from the North Pole, and on the opposite side of the planet from her home town of Perth, Western Australia. Her work as the international sales manager for a major tour operator enables her to combine two of her passions: travel and Svalbard.

"Emma&#x2019;s Land," "Gina&#x2019;s quarter," and "the Ingeborg Land" are reminders of the many women who homesteaded across North Dakota in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Land in Her Own Name records these homesteaders&#x2019; experiences as revealed in interviews with surviving homesteaders and their families and friends, land records, letters, and diaries.</p><p>These women&#x2019;s fascinating accounts tell of locating a claim, erecting a shelter, and living on the prairie. Their ethnic backgrounds include Yankee, Scandinavian, German, and German-Russian, as well as African American, Jewish, and Lebanese. Some were barely twenty-one, while others had reached their sixties. A few lived on their land for life and "never borrowed a cent against it"; others sold or rented the land to start a small business or to provide money for education.</p><p>For this paperback edition, Elizabeth Jameson&#x2019;s foreword situates the homesteading experience for women within the larger context of western history.</p></p><p><p><b>H.

This book was written to simplify that journey. As the author of When We Ruled a 700 plus page book on African history, I could also see the need to produce a smaller book that condenses and simplifies the information. I want to make the data as accessible as possible--hence this book. This book is in two parts. The first part is called If you want to learn Early African History START HERE. The second part is called 50 Questions and Answers on the History of Black People. The first part of the book, If you want to learn Early African History START HERE, is a general introduction to Classical African history covering the most important ancient and medieval empires. It began life as two separate lectures that I gave to introduce African history. One of the lectures was called When We Ruled: Thousands of Years of a Visible African Heritage. The second lecture was called The Lost Civilisations of Central Africa. To write this section of the book, I combined these two lectures into one narrative. In the final part of this section, I suggest other sources that a student could read to advance their knowledge even more. The second part of the book, 50 Questions and Answers on the History of Black People, began life when a colleague approached me to give him an extended interview on Black or African history. The colleague posed 50 varied questions to me to which I gave extended answers. He asked me about Nile Valley history, Ancient Kingdoms and Empires, The Slave Trade, earlier Black historians and their writings, etcetera. I hope that the 50 questions answer most of the questions that people raise concerning Black or African history.

Nowhere is this blend of respectful listening to the wisdom of the past and faithfulness to the Bible more necessary than in our contemporary reformulations of the doctrine of God's person.</p> <p>Bruce Ware believes that while tradition's emphasis on God's metaphysical perfection and His supremacy over the world is correct, we must refine our understanding of the way in which He relates to us. While retaining the deepest concerns of the historic tradition, Ware offers a more rational view of God's dealings with His children&#x2013;a view that is reflected in Scripture's own testimony of Him. Ware then applies this concept of real divine exaltation and real divine-human relationship to the areas of our prayer life, confidence in God and His guidance of us.</p></p><p><p><strong>Bruce A.

Here are briefs he filed as a lawyer, oral arguments for the landmark school desegregation cases, investigative reports on race riots and racism in the Army, speeches and articles outlining the history of civil rights and criticizing the actions of more conservative jurists, Supreme Court opinions now widely cited in Constitutional law, a long and complete oral autobiography, and much more. Marshall&#x2019;s impact on American race relations was greater than that of anyone else this century, for it was he who ended legal segregation in the United States. His victories as a lawyer for the NAACP broke the color line in housing, transportation, voting, and schools by overturning the long-established &#x201c;separate-but-equal&#x201d; doctrine. But Marshall was attentive to all social inequalities: no Supreme Court justice has ever been more consistent in support of freedom of expression, affirmative action, women&#x2019;s rights, abortion rights, and the right to consensual sex among adults; no justice has ever fought so hard against economic inequality, police brutality, and capital punishment.<br></p><p><b>Mark V. Tushnet</b> is a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center and is the author of <i>Making Civil Rights Law: Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court, 1936&#x2013;1961</i> and <i>Making Constitutional Law: Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court, 1961&#x2013;1991</i>. He lives in Washington, D.C.<br>Tushnet (Making Constitutional Law: Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court, 1961-1991), a constitutional law professor at Georgetown, captures the major facets of Marshall's remarkable career. The slim section of briefs and oral arguments, which Marshall presented as a lawyer to the Supreme Court, includes his Brown v. Board of Education brief, a 1944 brief against coerced confessions and an oral argument against halting the desegregation of Little Rock's schools. These are supplemented by a selection of writings for Crisis and other publications, including brief overviews of the progress made by different groups at various points from 1939 onward, riveting reports on the 1943 Detroit race riot and Marshall's investigation of 39 racially motivated courts-martial during the Korean War. His judicial writings include 12 of his annual remarks at the Second Circuit Judicial Conference, tributes to his Supreme Court colleague William Brennan and to his mentor, Charles Houston, reflections on the social responsibilities of the bar (such as adequate counsel for indigents and public interest litigation) and his famous speech on the Constitution's bicentennial, criticizing its flawed birth and celebrating the struggle to redeem it. The 12 opinions (mostly dissents) cover equal protection, affirmative action, privacy and free expression, poverty and criminal justice. Randall Kennedy's foreword cites Marshall's "unflagging persistence directed at exposing massive defects in American democracy," but these decisions display equal zeal for constructing and defending thoughtful, principled remedies. The concluding 100-page interview of 1977, from the Columbia Oral History Research Office, revisits earlier themes in an informal setting, while Tushnet supplies context sparingly, never intruding on Marshall's voice. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Woman Who Died a Lot: A Thursday Next Novel</h2><p><b>The seventh installment in Jasper Fforde&#x2019;s <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series follows literary detective Thursday Next on another adventure in her alternate reality of literature-obsessed England&#x2014;from the author of <i>Early Riser</i></b><br><br> With more than one million books in print worldwide, Jasper Fforde&#x2019;s beloved series charms a growing number of readers with each new adventure.

This great, sprawling rangeland was broken by lonely buttes and wandering ravines. It was a huge, almost empty, always challenging land. Its vastness made the small man smaller and the big man king.<br>Where once the shaggy-maned buffalo had grazed, a herd of six hundred red-coated Hereford cattle was gathered in a pocket of the plains. Held in place by an encircling group of riders, they bawled their discontent. Into this milling confusion, cowboys working in pairs walked their horses into the herd to slowly and methodically cut out the crippled cattle -- dry cows, the cows with poor spring calves, and the odd steer that had escaped the previous autumn's roundup.<br>Webb Calder pointed the nose of his claybank stud at the cow to be separated from the herd, then sat deep and easy in the saddle to let the horse do its work. The stallion was the color of the yellow mountain cat from which it took its name, Cougar. The instant the cow was isolated, the claybank frustrated its every attempt to rejoin the herd -- getting low, coming around on a dime, and springing forward with the swiftness of a cat.<br>To the big-boned man in the saddle, the rangy stallion was a source of pride. He'd picked the horse out of a range-wild group of yearlings and earmarked it for his personal remuda. The breaking and training he'd done himself, turning the animal into the best cow horse on the spread. It was never something Webb Calder bragged about, and any compliment was met with the casually indifferent reply, "The claybank is good."<br>He had a philosophy that if you were the best, you didn't have to tell anybody -- and if you weren't, then you'd damned well better keep your mouth shut. He lived by it, and expected the others around him to live by it, too.<br>When he and the yellow horse had the cow separated from the herd, the cowboys moved in from the flanks to push the animal over the lip of the ground's pocket to where the cut of injured or inferior cattle were being held. Two more riders took his place to work the herd.<br>Riding back to the gather, Webb was joined by Nate Moore, who had worked the cut with him. The lank, weather-beaten rider was one of a small corps of cowboys who had their roots dug as deep into this Montana range as Webb Calder had. Yet, some invisible quality stamped Webb Calder as the cattle owner.<br>For this was Calder land as far to the south as the eye could see, and beyond. All the livestock, except strays from the bordering small ranches to the north, carried the Triple C brand of the Calder Cattle Company. It was the heritage left by the first Calder who pulled up stakes in Texas and drove his herd north in 1878 to find free grass. That ancestor, Chase Benteen Calder, had carved out an empire that was measured in square miles numbering nearly six hundred. He'd held it against warring bands of renegade Indians, homesteaders, and jealously ambitious neighboring ranchers. He'd paid for it with Calder blood, nourished it with his sweat and the bones of drought-stricken cattle, and buried the Calder dead under the Montana grass.<br>Of the score of cowboys who had made the drive with Chase Benteen Calder, most had drifted, but a few had stayed to build a new life in this raw land. These men formed the nucleus of the group of forerunners to Nate Moore, Virg Haskell's wife, Ruth, Slim Trumbo, Ike Willis, and a handful of others, born and raised on the Calder ranch, like Webb. Their loyalty was a deep-seeded thing, ingrained into their souls as surely as if they carried the Triple C brand.<br>This thread of continuity ran through each generation, tying them together. The old ones eventually gave way to young blood, bringing change without ever changing.<br>Cresting the rise of the untamed plain, Webb reined in his horse. Satisfaction ran easy through him as he surveyed the scene before him, the teamwork of all the riders working the herd with efficient, well-oiled precision. He liked it best when he could get out among them. Although he was there out of necessity, since his decision determined which was the poorer stock to be culled from this herd, the sheer pleasure of the work made him take part in the actual cutting of the cattle.<br>The pressures and responsibilities were enormous and endless for the man who owned a ranch as vast as this. New salesmen or cattle buyers often commented on its size, and Webb was fond of quipping dryly, "It takes a big chunk of ground to fit under a Calder sky." He didn't know how it ranked against other big ranches in the country, whether it was first, second, third, or far down on the list. If anyone asked him, he couldn't have answered and he didn't care enough to check. His only interests lay in making it prosper and keeping it intact for his son.<br>The responsibilities were heavy, but so was the power he wielded. Webb Calder believed himself to be a fair man. There were some who would say he was exacting. And still others would claim that he ruled with an iron hand. Resentment born out of envy and jealousy made him the object of hatred from a silent few. As far as Webb Calder was concerned, he had never raised his hand against a man without cause. When he acted, it was swift and with purpose. Indecision could eventually spell disaster for an outfit the size of the Triple C.<br>It was one of the things he'd tried to teach his son, Chase Calder, named after their Texan ancestor. There was more to running a ranch than keeping books, raising cattle, and going to the bank. But how do you teach a man to be a leader, to handle men?<br>Before Chase had taken his first step, Webb had set the baby boy on a saddle atop an old bellmare and wrapped the tiny fists around the saddle horn to take him on his first ride. By the time Chase was two, he was given the reins. When he was five, he went on his first roundup, tied to the saddle so he wouldn't fall off if he fell asleep.<br>Horses and cattle were part of living. Those things Chase learned by osmosis, unconsciously absorbing the knowledge into his system until it was second nature.<br>But it was the subtleties of command that Webb wanted him to learn. From the time the boy had understood his first sentence, Webb had tried to drum these things into his head, shaping and molding Chase to take over the ranch someday. He'd warned Chase that as his son, he would have to work longer, be smarter, and fight rougher than any man-jack out there. No favor would ever be granted him by Webb -- no concession would ever be made because Chase was a Calder. There would be no special privileges because he was the rancher's son. In fact, the reverse would be true. In his teens, Chase had the hardest jobs, the rankest horses, and the longest hours of any man on the place. Any problems were his to solve. If there was trouble, he had to be man enough to fight his way out of it, either with his fists or his wits. Chase couldn't come to his father and expect help. Webb pushed him as hard as he dared without breaking the boy's spirit.<br>Even as Webb Calder watched the two dozen horsemen at work, he unconsciously and instinctively kept an eye on his son. Chase was taller than the average cowboy, wide in the shoulders and solid in the chest, yet youthfully lean and supple with a rider's looseness about him. The sun had burned a layer of tan over hard and angular Calder features. Dark-haired and dark-eyed, he seemed older than twenty-two -- except when he smiled. Then he seemed careless and guileless. His son was still an unknown quantity to Webb. Maybe some might think he demanded too much, but he was firmly convinced it was the tough things that were good for a man.<br>The horse beside the claybank blew out a relaxed snort, making Webb shift his glance to Nate Moore. He was building a smoke and licked the paper with a stingy tongue. Without looking up, he spoke. "He's a good boy." He guessed the object of Webb's thoughts.<br>"Lil would be proud of him." Webb uttered his late wife's name and broke a silence that had lasted more than twenty years since her death. Time had erased the grief of his loss. Now the memory of her was another tradition.<br>It was something an outsider couldn't understand -- this lack of expression the true Western man showed when he lost a comrade or a loved one -- the failure to reveal keen sorrow. What a man felt was kept inside. The face an outsider saw looked cold and unemotional. Yet beneath the hard exteriors of these men, there was all the delicate sensitivity of a woman, hidden from view. Revealing it displayed weakness. This was a land where only the strong survived.<br>"Yes, she would," Nate spoke with the cigarette in his mouth and squinted his eyes at the pungent smoke curling from it. The expression deepened the sun-creased lines splaying from the corners of his eyes. Without turning his head, his attention shifted to the young cowboy, Buck Haskell, riding on the same side of the herd where Chase was. For apparently no reason, Buck had spun his sorrel horse to face the opposite direction and spurred it toward a slight gap between riders, reaching an invisible point the instant a cow attempted to break from the herd. Respect glinted in the older cowhand's eyes. "That Buckie has more cow sense than some cowboys three times his age," Nate declared. "And how he loves those rank broncs. The more contrary they are, the better he likes 'em."<br>Webb's mouth tightened. "Yeah, and he's always got his rope down. I've never caught him at it, but I know he does."<br>"Hell!" Nate chuckled. "Every young cowboy is going to sneak off and rope something now and then."<br>Webb conceded that with a lift of his heavy brows. "Buck is a likable boy, but I worry about that wild streak in him."<br>With curly blond hair, blue eyes, and a perpetual grin, Buck was Virg and Ruth Haskell's son, born two days before Chase. When Webb's wife, Lillian, didn't have enough milk to breast-feed Chase, Ruth had taken over as wetnurse. A year and a half later, after Lil had died, Ruth cooked and kept house for Webb. So Buck and Chase had been raised practically as brothers. It was natural that Webb took extra interest in Buck.<br>The hand-rolled cigarette never left Nate's mouth, but he managed to pull the corners into a dry smile. "You're forgettin', Webb. We were wilder than that when we were twenty-two."<br>He exchanged a wry glance with the cowboy. "Maybe so."<br>From the broken land to the north, a trio of riders approached the herd's gathering point. Webb centered his gaze on the short, wiry rider a half-stride in the lead. His face lost its expression, becoming heavyboned and hard.<br>"Who's that with O'Rourke?" He didn't take his eyes from the owner of the small, two-bit spread on a north strip of the Calder boundary.<br>Nate looked, his eyes narrowing less from the smoke and more from recognition. "His boy. The skinny one must be his girl." He had pulled the warmth from his voice, making it flat.<br>As he skimmed the pair riding with Angus O'Rourke, Webb inspected first the gangling eighteen-year-old boy with lank black hair sticking out from beneath his hat. The boy kept looking at his father, seeking some form of guidance. The girl was a small slip of a thing, looking more like a young boy than a girl. There was a glimpse of the slick, black sides of her hair beneath the hat, but Webb couldn't tell whether it was cut that short or pushed under the crown. Both the shirt and the Levi's appeared to be cast-offs of her brother's. Both were too large, making her look all the more skinny and shapeless. Except for the heavy fringe of lashes around her green eyes, there was nothing about the set of her features to distinguish her from an immature boy. There were spurs on the heels of her rundown boots, an old and cracked pair of leather gloves on her hands, and an ill-fitting jacket dwarfing her small frame. The sight of her rankled Webb.<br>"A girl shouldn't be doing a man's work," he muttered and turned his head to thrust his hard gaze at Nate. "You ride down there and tell the men to watch their language. If I hear so much as a 'goddamn' out of them with that girl around, there's going to be hell to pay when she leaves."<br>Nate pinched the fire off the end of his cigarette, letting the ember fall into the cuff of his denims, where it was crushed dead. The unsmoked portion of the cigarette was tucked away in his pocket as he reined his mount toward the cowboys working the herd.<br>Webb watched him leave. The modern world may have advanced into the space age with computers and high technology, but there were sections of the West where time had changed very little. Everything was more mechanized, but most of the work was still done on horseback.<br>The old codes lingered. Women were scarce and treated with respect until they showed they didn't deserve it. A man settled his own problems; he didn't take them to someone else. It wasn't hard to understand when put in perspective. In the case of the Triple C, there was a thirty-five-mile-long driveway before you reached the front porch of the main house. A respectable-sized town of more than a population of one hundred could be a hundred miles away, and more.<br>The Calder ranch sat on an area of land larger than the state of Rhode Island. With the kind of power that gave Webb Calder, he was virtually his own law, answerable to almost no one but God Almighty. Wisely, he never tried to ride roughshod over anyone else, only now and then letting his authority be felt. He turned a blind eye to the dirt-farming Andersen family trying to eke out a living on a half-section of ground on his east boundary. Webb knew they butchered a steer or two of his each year, but he wouldn't see women and children go hungry. But God help the man who lifted his hand against the Triple C for his own gain.<br>His gaze narrowed in silent speculation on Angus O'Rourke, who was riding toward him. The man spent too much time dreaming and found too many excuses for why he couldn't succeed. O'Rourke was a weak man, always wanting the easy way. There wasn't any place for that kind in this country. Sooner or later they were weeded out.<br>The hard, fixed stare from Calder made Angus uncomfortable. How he'd love to ride up and spit in the man's eye. He licked his dry lips nervously, telling himself that the day would come when he wouldn't have to kowtow to the likes of Webb Calder. But the assurance was old and rang hollow in his mind. He'd been a dark, handsome man once, with glib Irish charm, but lines of dissipation were beginning to take away his looks, and people no longer believed in his grandiose plans for the future, having heard too many in the past that came to naught.<br>"If he asks us anything, what should we say?" The anxiously whispered question came from his son.<br>Angus didn't turn his head or look around to answer. "Don't say anything. I'll do the talking."<br>"I told you we should have hazed those thirty head back across the fence last week, Pa," the girl stated calmly.<br>"And I told you they needed a few more days of good grass, Maggie!" The argument had already been hashed over several times. "Those cows just strayed, that's all. And we're just here to cut out our strays, like we always do."<br>He reined his horse down to a walk to cross the last few yards to Webb Calder, stopping at a right angle to him. Flashing the man one of his patented smiles, he respectfully touched a finger to the pointed brim of his Stetson.<br>"Good morning, Mr. Calder." Angus O'Rourke sounded deliberately cheerful and carefree.<br>"Angus." The stone-faced man with the hard eyes simply nodded in response to the greeting.<br>Irritation rippled through Angus. He was angry with himself for not calling Calder by his first name, and putting them on equal terms. The man had a way of making him feel worthless...</p><h2>Student Activity Book (softcover), Volume 1 Grade 5 2015 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Math Expressions)</h2><p>New.

While publications dating back to 1901 have attempted to compile such a listing, none until now has so exhaustively harvested the 214 historic maps drawn between 1544, when Hernando de Soto's entourage first came through the southeastern territory, and 1846, when Indian removal to the Oklahoma Territory was complete. Wright combines the map data with a keen awareness of both previously published information and archival sources, such as colonial town lists, census information, and travel narratives.<br><br> The towns are listed alphabetically, and the text of each entry develops chronologically. While only a few of these towns have been accurately located by archaeologists, this volume provides a wealth of information for the future study of cultural geography, southeastern archaeology, and ethnohistory. It will be an enduring reference source for many years to come.<br><br> <b>SAMPLE ENTRY,<br> </b><br> <b>ALIBAMA TOWN</b> (Alibama)<br> The <b>Alibama</b> consisted of several towns&#x2014;Mucclassa, Tawasa, Tomopa, Koarsati (Knight 1981, 27:48). Pickett ([1851] 1962:81) adds Ecanchati, Pawokti, and Autauga. The Alibama Town can also be added. Many maps show the Alibama as a group, but one map, 1796 Thomas and Andrews, locates the "Alabama Town"on the east bank of the Coosa just below Wetumpka.<br><br> Swanton ([1922] 1970a:209) wrote that the Tuskegee at the Alabama forks may have been known as the "Alabama Town"; however, this is unlikely, as Major W. Blue, a removal agent, wrote in July 1835 that Coosada, Alabama Town, and Tuskegee were ready to emigrate and they all lived adjoining each other in Macon County (ASP, Military Affairs 1861,6:731).</p><p>On 6 July 1838, some twenty-seven towns, including "Alibama" (NA M234 R225), attended the Creek council held in Indian Territory. Thomas Bibb, brother to Alabama territorial govenor William Wyatt Bibb, and others, including Nashville investors, founded the town of Alabama in 1817 at Ten Mile Bluff in Montgomery County (Moser 1980-94, 4:131).

Yet, in spite of all advances and the new place they occupy in world affairs, many peoples of African descent are desperately still struggling to overcome war, fear, disease, political dissention, corruption, mutual distrust, and human rights abuses. Historian and Professor Mario Azevedo and his colleagues have attempted in this volume to present aspects of the black world by exposing students, faculty, and other readers to the experiences, achievements, and aspirations of those who have long been considered to be the Wretched of the Earth. This book covers the turbulent but also compelling themes of the lives of continental Africans and those in the Diaspora their history, which transcends millenia; their human expressions in art and music; the uniqueness of their manifestations in literature; their efforts at eliminating disease and pestilence; their traditional religions and the interpretation of the cosmos; the state of their science, sports, and business; the plight of their most vulnerable, such as women, children, and the poor; their interaction across the continents; and the many other critical issues that affect the lives of people scattered across the globe. The fourth edition of <i>Africana Studies</i> is a succinct, accessible, and readable source of knowledge, written by experts, that covers the black world in-depth and with breadth. Professor Azevedo and the other contributors have created a compendium of knowledge that looks at both traditional and contemporary theories in the field of African and Diaspora Studies, while also providing a glimpse of what the future holds.</p><p>Mario Azevedo is Interim Dean of the College of Public Service and a Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Jackson State University.</p><h2>Teaching Statistics: A Bag of Tricks</h2><p>Students in the sciences, economics, social sciences, and medicine take an introductory statistics course. And yet statistics can be notoriously difficult for instructors to teach and for students to learn.

She warns the other animals but they are apathetic. More and more of the thing reveals itself until Hattie realizes it's a fox. Her pronouncement turns apathy to frenzy; the cow's loud moo scares the fox away. The animals are so surprised that they remain silent. Readers hope that in the future, Hattie's words will be given more importance by the barnyard animals. Author Fox builds the suspense in this cumulative tale with precise pacing. Mullins uses tissue-paper collage and crayon to create an unusual effect, both fuzzy and comic. The animals whether watchful predator, the lethargic barnyard variety or an alert Hattieare wonderfully expressive and characterized.

Keener is professor of New Testament at Asbury Theological Seminary, Wilmore, Kentucky. He is the author of many other books, including <em>The Gospel of Matthew: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary</em> and <em>The Gospel of John: A Commentary</em><b>&#x2014; Richard Bauckham</b><br> &#x201c;I have long thought that what we need is to be able to place the Gospels much more precisely within the wide spectrum of ancient biographies. Keener has mastered the literature, primary and secondary&#x2014;as one would expect.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Markus Bockmuehl</b><br> &#x2014; University of Oxford<br> &#x201c;This is a welcome guide to some of the best recent scholarship on the biographical purpose and composition of the Gospels, taking due account of the impact of memory in their composition. Prof. Keener sensibly concludes that living memory played a meaningful and consolidating role in the formation of these rhetorically constructed but essentially historical narratives about Jesus. A thorough and reliable introduction to this vital yet complex subject!&#x201d;<br><br><b>Alanna Nobbs</b><br> &#x2014;&nbsp;Macquarie University<br> &#x201c;This work displays extensive knowledge of the major classical texts from around the New Testament period. Keener uses these judiciously and critically, as an ancient historian would do for any primary source, showing awareness of genre and bias and using modern studies of memory and its impact on historiography. Thus he provides an integrated and convincing historical picture.&#x201d;<br><br><b>James H. Charlesworth</b><br> &#x2014; Princeton Theological Seminary<br> &#x201c;Less than two decades ago, New Testament experts concurred that no one can or will ever publish a biography of Jesus. Why? It is because former scholars concluded that the authors of the Gospels are all biased, even creating traditions not from history but from the proclamations about Jesus. Now, thanks to archaeological and historical studies, we know that the descriptions of some Galilean villages and Jerusalem in the Gospels prove that the Evangelists accurately described some installations; they knew what we did not formerly know. To claim that a biography must be objective reduces the inviting and informative biographies to a mere list of unrelated episodes that may masquerade as facts. We also now have hundreds of compositions from Jesus&#x2019;s time that were either unknown to previous scholars or misinterpreted by them. The Gospels belong among the ancient biographies. Craig Keener&#x2019;s study reflects the new data and perspectives and is a gift to many. Keener is certainly in the front ranks of experts on Jesus. The book is astoundingly well researched, balanced in judgment, and ideal for various classes.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Vernon K. Robbins</b><br> &#x2014; Emory University<br> &#x201c;Another vintage book by Craig Keener! Comprehensive information showing the relation of New Testament Gospels to early Roman empire biography, embedded in argumentation for historical reliability of most information in the New Testament Gospels.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Craig A. Evans</b><br> &#x2014; Houston Baptist University<br> &#x201c;Craig Keener&#x2019;s sophisticated knowledge of the classical world is in evidence in his impressive&nbsp;<i>Christobiography</i>. He not only knows the sources; he asks of them the proper questions, such as what first-century readers expected of biographies. Keener rightly focuses on the biographies of the early Roman Empire. He also rightly takes into account the important fact that the New Testament Gospels were composed within living memory of their subject and that this tradition arose from the disciples of Jesus, who by definition were committed to learning their master&#x2019;s teaching and recalling his deeds. Keener&#x2019;s book makes a much-needed contribution to a very important topic.&#x201d;<br><br><b>David Aune</b><br> &#x2014; University of Notre Dame<br> &#x201c;Craig Keener argues convincingly that ancient readers of Greek and Latin biographies from the period of the early Roman Empire (e.g., Cornelius Nepos, Plutarch, Suetonius, and Tacitus) had the same expectation as those who read the Gospels, expecting them to preserve the gist of what their subjects had actually said and done. Along the way, Keener provides an up-to-date summary of modern memory studies. In the early Christian community, the eyewitnesses who provided data for inclusion in the Gospels were also disciples who were highly motivated to preserve the legacy of Jesus. Basically, this is a book that sheds light on the epistemology of historical Jesus research. Anyone seriously interested in the historical Jesus will find this book both rich and rewarding.&#x201d;<br><br><b>David P. Moessner</b><br> &#x2014; Texas Christian University<br> &#x201c;Keener&#x2019;s ability to read both widely and deeply through an expansive swath of primary literature of the Greco-Roman world, to detect telling evidence and articulate those insights that transform conventional wisdom and reconfigure the terms of the debate, is, quite frankly, without parallel. Through new appropriations of &#x2018;memory studies,&#x2019; biographical history in the early empire, and an illuminating taxonomy of both Greek and Jewish biography, Keener makes an exceptional case that the narration of the story of Jesus in the four Gospels is a thoroughly mixed hybrid of biographical and historiographical concerns such that a new subset of literature emerges, the&nbsp;<i>Christobiography</i>. Keener&#x2019;s opus now forms a new watershed in Gospel genre studies.&#x201d;<br><br><b>&#x2014; James D. G. Dunn</b><br> &#x201c;<i>Christobiography&nbsp;</i>is addressed to both scholars and students interested in Gospel and historical Jesus research and is, to say the least, a very impressive study. The Synoptic Gospels compare well with other ancient biographies as to the reliability of the information they provide. They told the same stories, but often without concern for details extraneous to their point. Not least of interest is the striking summary of the overlap between John and the Synoptics, showing that John is still a historical biography. There is a very helpful chapter on memory and the reliability of oral tradition in the context of Jesus&#x2019;s ministry and his followers, given that it was understood as teaching. The strong and justified conclusion is that Jesus&#x2019;s disciples would have learned and transmitted his teaching no less carefully than most other disciples the wisdom of their teachers. In short, the Gospels compare well with the other biographies of the time as to their historicity, and there is a strong historical probability that the Gospel memoirs have preserved the content and character of Jesus&#x2019;s ministry and teaching. I cannot commend this careful and thorough study too highly.&#x201d;</p><h2>In Deep: The FBI, the CIA, and the Truth about America&#39;s &#34;Deep State&#34;</h2><p><p><strong>A two-time Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist&#x2019;s eye-opening investigation of the so-called deep state.</strong></p><p>A recent poll found that 74 percent of Americans believe that a group of unelected government and military officials is secretly manipulating or directing national policy.

Paul Patton&#39;s introduction surveying the debate aroused by the conflict argues that Baudrillard, more than any other critic of the events, correctly identified the political stakes involved in the gestation of the New World Order.</p><p>The hypothesis of this book is that the deterrence of war in the traditional sense has been internalized and turned back upon the Western powers, producing a form of self-deterrence which renders them incapable of realizing their own power in the form of relations of force.<p>JEAN BAUDRILLARD is the author of many books, including The Transparency of Evil, America, Evil Demon of Images, and For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign.</p></p><h2>Ringo: With a Little Help</h2><p><i>Ringo: With a Little Help</i> is the first in-depth biography of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr, who kept the beat for an entire generation and who remains a rock icon over fifty years since the Beatles took the world by storm. <i>With a Little Help</i> traces the entire arc of Ringo's remarkable life and career, from his sickly childhood to his life as The World's Most Famous drummer to his triumphs, addictions, and emotional battles following the breakup of the Beatles as he comes to terms with his legacy.<br><br>Born in 1940 as Richard Starkey in the Dingle, one of Liverpool's most gritty, rough-and-tumble neighborhoods, he rose from a hardscrabble childhood &#x2013; marked by serious illnesses, long hospital stays, and little schooling &#x2013; to emerge, against all odds, as a locally renowned drummer. Taking the stage name Ringo Starr, his big break with the Beatles rocketed him to the pinnacle of worldwide acclaim in a remarkably short time. He was the last member of the Beatles to join the group but also the most vulnerable, and his post-Beatles career was marked by chart-topping successes, a jet-setting life of excess and alcohol abuse, and, ultimately, his rebirth as one of rock's revered elder statesman.</p><p><b>Michael Seth Starr</b> (Northern, New Jersey) is the TV editor for the <i>New York Post</i>, where he has written about television for the past twenty years. He has authored biographies of Peter Sellers, Art Carney, Joey Bishop, Bobby Darin, Raymond Burr, and Redd Fox.In this illuminating and comprehensive biography of Richard ''Ringo Starr'' Starkey, New York Post TV editor Starr delves into every aspect of the life of one of the 20th century's most famous drummers. Beatles fans may come away disappointed at the lack of truly new material regarding Ringo's tenure with the band, much of which is culled from the Beatles Anthology documentary. That said, Starr successfully paints a complete portrait of the legendary drummer, whose contributions to rock 'n' roll, he argues, have largely been overshadowed by his iconic bandmates. With aplomb, Starr creates an intimate picture of Liverpool and Hamburg during the 1950s and '60s that puts the rest of Ringo's life (including his later battles with alcoholism and drug addiction) into fascinating perspective. Starr's prose is straightforward, at times stilted, but frequent eyewitness accounts and quotes from original interviews with Ringo's friends and family help him succeed in revealing the nuanced and passionate man who was the backbone of the Beatles. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>It's a solid recounting of Ringo's life and will be of interest to Beatles fans looking for more information on the least-chronicled member of the Fab Four. -Booklist Online <br> <br> Extensive research and an injection of personality make this a definitive biography of the most underrated Beatle. -Foreword Reviews <br> <br> Until Ringo pens his memoirs (if he ever does), this biography will serve as the most complete and up-to-date telling of his life story. --Library Journal Xpress Reviews, June 26, 2015<br><br>''Through assiduous research, the author (no relation) paints a nuanced picture of Ringo as a charismatic, likeable character, whose flaws were opened by success.'' -MOJO Magazine <br><br>''Too few books have chronicled Ringo Starr's professional and personal life, but this new tome by Michael Seth Starr (no relation) thoroughly examines the drummer's story from his Liverpool beginnings to his current solo career'' -Something Else Reviews <br><br> ''Ringo: With a Little Help'' is clearly the definitive biography of one of the most famous musicians - or, heck, people - of the last century (though author Starr could not get subject Starr to participate). And, while he did get help along the way, Richard Starkey richly deserves this solid literary treatment. --Houston Chronicle</p><h2>Chosen for Life: The Case for Divine Election</h2><p><p>Divine election is certainly one of the more profound&#x2015;and controversial&#x2015;doctrines in the Bible. Does God elect people because they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, or does God elect people in order that they will believe in Christ? Much of the disagreement and controversy concerning this doctrine proceeds from a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means.</p><p>This is why Storms begins his analysis of divine election with an attempt to clarify precisely what is at stake and, at the same time, correct misrepresentations of it. He takes a thorough look at the doctrine as it is presented in Romans 9 as well as the rest of the New Testament. He also explores freedom of will and the order of salvation.

He lives with his wife and daughter in Mandeville, Louisiana.YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN my father's arms. He didn't lift weights or do push-ups or exercise them in any way, and yet they were packed tight with muscle. When I was a boy and he lifted his highball in the evening for a sip, a round knot the size of a softball came up under the skin and slowly flattened out when he lowered the glass back down. I loved his arms so much that I memorized every vein, sinew, and golden hair. I knew the wrinkles of his elbows.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the summer, when he worked for the city's recreation department, supervising the baseball program at the park, Daddy liked to come home for lunch and a nap. He had lemonade and a BLT, then he had me lie close to him on the sofa, and he draped an arm around me. &#x201c;One ... two ... three ... &#x201c; he'd count in a whisper, and then he was out, sleeping that easily.<br> &nbsp;<br> I lay there wondering if I'd ever have arms like his. I needed both hands to travel the distance around his wrist, the tips of my thumbs and fingers barely touching. I felt the hardness of his forearm. I saw how his wedding band fit him like a strand of barbed wire on a tree whose bark had grown around it. He smelled of the grass and the sun, of green and gold days that started early and ended late.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Were you a good player?&#x201d; I asked him once as he was coming awake.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Was I what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A good player.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You want to know if I was a good player?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What kind of question is that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don't know. Did they run your name in the paper a lot?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked at me in a way that let me know he wanted my attention. &#x201c;None of it matters, John Ed. Was I a good teammate? Did I do my best and give everything I had to help the team? These are the questions you need to be asking.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I wondered how to answer them, these questions he found of such importance. Many years would have to pass before I was old enough to join a team. He pulled me close again, as if he'd just remembered something. &#x201c;John Ed?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Always be humble.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The rest of the year he worked as a civics teacher and coach at the high school in town. The town was Opelousas, on the road between Alexandria and Lafayette, and it was just small enough, at about twenty thousand, to be excluded from Louisiana state maps when TV weathermen gave their forecasts in the evening. In the morning, my father left home wearing coach's slacks with sharp creases and a polo shirt with a Tiger emblem and the words OHS FOOTBALL printed in Halloween orange on the left breast, the lettering melted from too much time in the dryer. A whistle hung from a nylon cord around his neck. It was still hanging there when he returned at night and sat down to a cold supper&#x2014;the same meal Mama had served her children hours earlier. &#x201c;You don't want me to warm it for you, Johnny?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, baby. That's okay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes in the afternoon, Mama drove me out to the school. She parked under the oak tree by the gymnasium, pointed to where she wanted me to go, and I walked out past a gate in a hurricane fence to the field where my father and the other coaches were holding practice. Four years old, I wore the same crew cut that my father wore. I stumbled through tall grass and out past the red clay track that encircled the field. At home, my father didn't raise his voice, but here he seemed to shout with every breath. A team manager took me by the hand and led me to a long pine bench on the sideline. I sat among metal coolers, spare shoulder pads and toolboxes crammed with first aid supplies. I waited until the last drill had ended and the players came one after another to the coolers for water the same temperature as the day, drunk in single gulps from paper cups shaped like cones. The players took turns giving the top of my head a mussing. &#x201c;You gonna play football when you grow up?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don't know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You gonna be a coach like your daddy?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I want to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Already I was certain that no one mattered more than a coach. I would trade any day to come for a chance to be that boy again, understanding for the first time who his father was. Give me August and two-a-days and a group of teenagers who are now old men, their uniforms stained green from the grass and black with Louisiana loam. Give me my father's voice as he shouts to them, pushing them harder than they believe they can go, willing them to be better. Give me my father when practice is over and he walks to where I'm sitting and reaches his arms out to hold me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I HEARD IT when I was a kid. I still hear it. You run into a former ballplayer and give him a minute, and suddenly he's haranguing you about the deleterious effects of global warming on the game of football, arguing that the sunshine that lit the fields back when he played was more golden than it is today. As a matter of fact, everything was better back then&#x2014;before the world went all to hell. You played with broken ribs and noses, tonsil and toenail problems, abscessed teeth and even certain gastrointestinal disorders, and instead of steroids and human growth hormones, you fed yourself a diet rich in protein and complex carbohydrates. Want to get bigger and stronger? Take a B12 shot and wash down half a dozen raw eggs with breakfast. For lunch, eat a twenty-ounce sirloin pan-fried in butter. After supper, get a soupspoon and carve a hole in a tub of ice cream.<br> &nbsp;<br> I suppose it's easy to understand why so many of these old boys come off as a little sour&#x2014;their prime is past, their future uncertain. And I suppose it's also easy to dismiss them out of hand for being such miserable bores. But then one of them will suddenly stop editorializing and focus on the memory of a teammate. This is when things get interesting. A moment ago, the crusty bear was complaining that no college coach is worth three million dollars a year and that TV timeouts make games drag on too long. Now he's bawling into his hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> I'm guilty of being confused about a lot of things, but I understand why teammates always get a pass. Once upon a time I played the game, although that might be hard to believe to look at me today, with my hair streaked gray and my neck about as big around as a pencil. I was a center for Louisiana State University in the late 1970s, back when Charles McClendon was coach, and I played with people who were so good to me that I've often wondered if I was somehow ruined by their goodness.

Have a fullback step up out of nowhere and pick up the blitzing linebacker that you, anchor of the line, failed to block.<br> &nbsp;<br> I probably think about my LSU teammates more than I should. No, I'm sure I do. I wonder what they've gone and done with their lives. Do they have grandkids? Have they made money? Are they happy?<br> &nbsp;<br> On more than a few occasions, while out on the road for a magazine assignment, I've spotted young men who brought old teammates to mind. One might have the same self-assured stride as our top wide receiver, while another has a profile nearly identical to that of a reserve quarterback. Though I'm never tempted to walk up to one of them and humiliate myself by peppering him with questions, I often imagine the conversation we'd have. &#x201c;You know, you look like a college buddy I had a long time ago. Of course, I haven't seen him in ages. For all I know, he could weigh four hundred pounds and get around in one of those motorized scooters. Or maybe he died. But I swear, you look just like him. You're not related to Leigh Shepard, are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;God, did that boy have potential. If he hadn't worn his knees out and quit the squad to return home to Texas, he surely would've been a great one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And on and on it goes, my description of Leigh Shepard or whomever else growing more detailed as I ramble on.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is an odd confession, but until about ten years ago, I could rattle off the entire numerical roster for the 1979 LSU football team, beginning with the lowest digit, Don Barthel's number 1, and ending with the highest, Mark Ippolito's 99. When I encountered a number on a billboard or highway sign, I automatically associated it with a teammate. Once when I was driving through southern Louisiana, I saw a roadside marker for U.S. 90. Demetri Williams, I thought to myself. What a fine defensive lineman. He had real quick feet coming off the ball and could obliterate you with a swim move if you didn't pop him in the mouth right off the snap. Used to stand in front of a mirror in the locker room after practice combing his hair with a pick, working out the indentations left by the padding of his helmet.<br> &nbsp;<br> At home at night, I'd watch the weather forecast and hear &#x201c;thirty-five degrees in Baton Rouge&#x201d; and find myself saying to the screen, &#x201c;That's cold. Better wear your winter coat, Rusty Brown.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yes, Rusty wore number 35.<br> &nbsp;<br> Crazy, I tell you.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here's another confession: I still remember the most insignificant things about my teammates, even though I have to concentrate to tell you what I had for dinner last night. I remember how tall they were and how much they weighed&#x2014;that's easy&#x2014;but I also remember things that don't matter anymore, that probably never mattered: the kinds of cars they drove, the music they played in the dorm, how many letters they earned, their injuries, their dreams, their girlfriends&#x2019; favorite lipstick colors, the length of their sideburns, their times in the 40-yard dash.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Trees, Leaves, Flowers and Seeds: A visual encyclopedia of the plant kingdom</h2><p><p>A unique and beautiful children's guide to the extraordinary world of plants, from the smallest seeds to the tallest trees. </p><p>We couldn't live without plants. We need them for food, shelter, even the air we breathe, yet we know surprisingly little about them. Why do thistles bristle with spines? How do some plants trap and eat insects? Did you know there are trees more than 5,000 years old? <i>Trees, Leaves, Flowers &amp; Seeds</i> explores the mysterious world of plants to find the answers to these and many more questions. </p><p>Each type of plant - such as a flowering plant, a tree, a grass, or cactus - is examined close-up, with an example shown from all angles and even in cross-section. Then picture-packed galleries show the wonderful variety of plants on different themes, perhaps the habitat they grow in, a flower family, or the plants that supply us with our staple foods. But the book also takes a fun, more sideways look at some truly weird and wonderful plants, including trees with fruits like a giant's fingers, orchids that look like monkey faces, seeds that spin like helicopters, and trees that drip poison. </p><p>So open this fascinating book and find out more about the amazing world of trees, leaves, flowers, and seeds.</p></p><p></p><h2>Provincetown Seafood Cookbook</h2><p><b>A delightful collection of classic recipes, folk history, and original drawings by Cape Cod's most-admired chef.

James Howard Mitcham was born in Winona, Mississippi and graduated from Greenville High School together with his friend the writer Shelby Foote. At the age of 16 Mitcham became deaf from spinal meningitis, but that didn't seem to stop him or even slow him down as he regaled friends with stories in his booming, Southern-accented voice. He earned a degree in art and architecture at Louisiana State University, then moved to New York's Greenwich Village, where he ran the Jane Street Gallery in the 1940s. Many of Mitcham's friends learned sign language to converse with him. For people who didn't know how to sign, Mitcham would carry notebooks and pens so they could write him notes. He co-authored a food column for the Provincetown Advocate with Jan Kelly, who called Mitcham "brilliant [and] never boring. Mitcham died on August 22nd, 1996, at the age of 79.<br>Anthony&nbsp;Bourdain&nbsp;is a writer, Emmy&nbsp;and Peabody&nbsp;Award-winning television personality,&nbsp;and former chef.

Every chronic pain condition has a treatable myofascial trigger point component, including fibromyalgia. Many of the localized symptoms now considered as fibromyalgia are actually due to trigger points. The central sensitization of fibromyalgia amplifies symptoms that trigger points cause, and this book teaches care providers and patients how to identify and treat those causes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chronic myofascial pain due to trigger points can be body-wide, and can cause or maintain fibromyalgia central sensitization. Trigger points can cause and/or maintain or contribute to many types of pain and dysfunction, including numbness and tingling, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, plantar fasciitis, osteoarthritis, cognitive dysfunctions and disorientation, impotence, incontinence, loss of voice, pelvic pain, muscle weakness, menstrual pain, TMJ dysfunction, shortness of breath, and many symptoms attributed to old age or "atypical" or psychological sources. <br> &nbsp;<br> Trigger point therapy has been around for decades, but only recently have trigger points been imaged at the Mayo Clinic and National Institutes of Health. Their ubiquity and importance is only now being recognized.<br> &nbsp;<br> Devin Starlanyl is a medically trained chronic myofascial pain and fibromyalgia researcher and educator, as well as a patient with both of these conditions. She has provided chronic pain education and support to thousands of patients and care providers around the world for decades. John Sharkey is a physiologist with more than twenty-seven years of anatomy experience, and the director of a myofascial pain facility. Together they have written a comprehensive reference to trigger point treatment to help patients with fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, and many other conditions.<br> &nbsp;<br> This guide will be useful for all types of doctors, nurses, therapists, bodyworkers, and lay people, facilitating communication between care providers and patients and empowering patients who now struggle with all kinds of misunderstood and unexplained symptoms.<br> &nbsp;<br> Part 1 explains what trigger points are and how they generate symptoms, refer pain and other symptoms to other parts of the body, and create a downward spiral of dysfunction. The authors look at the interconnection between fibromyalgia and myofascial trigger points and their possible causes and symptoms; identify stressors that perpetuate trigger points such as poor posture, poor breathing habits, nutritional inadequacies, lack of sleep, and environmental and psychological factors; and provide a list of over one hundred pain symptoms and their most common corresponding trigger point sources.<br> &nbsp;<br> Part 2 describes the sites of trigger points and their referral patterns within each region of the body, and provides pain relief solutions for fibromyalgia and trigger point patients and others with debilitating symptoms. Pain treatment plans include both self-help remedies for the patient&#x2014;stretching or postural exercises, self-massage techniques and prevention strategies&#x2014;as well as diagnostic and treatment hints for care providers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Part 3 offers guidance for both patients and care providers in history taking, examination, and palpation skills, as well as treatment options. It offers a vision for the future that includes early assessment, adequate medical training, prevention of fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis, changes to chronic pain management and possible solutions to the health care crisis, and a healthier version of our middle age and golden years, asserting that patients have a vital role to play in the management of their own health.</p><p>DEVIN J.

In this groundbreaking biography of the band, veteran music writer and historian Jeff Tamarkin produces a portrait of the band like none that has come before it. Having worked closely with Jefferson Airplane for more than a decade, Tamarkin had unprecedented access to the band members, their families, friends, lovers, crew members, fellow musicians, cultural luminaries, even the highest-ranking politicians of the time. More than just a definitive history, Got a Revolution! is a rock legend unto itself. <br> Jann Wenner, editor-in-chief and publisher of <i>Rolling Stone</i>, wrote, "The classic [Jefferson] Airplane lineup were both architects and messengers of a psychedelic age, a liberation of mind and body that profoundly changed American art, politics, and spirituality. It was a renaissance that could only have been born in San Francisco, and the Airplane, more than any other band in town, spread the good news nationwide."</p><p>This book is the culmination of five years of intense work, but its genesis really dates back to the summer of 1967 when, as a rock and roll kid living on Long Island, I heard "Somebody To Love," "White Rabbit" and then the Surrealistic Pillow album for the first time. The music of Jefferson Airplane suggested a more stimulating way of life and transported me to another place. <p>Nine years later, ensconced in a tiny Haight-Ashbury apartment in San Francisco, I began writing about music professionally, and began interviewing members of what had by then split off into Jefferson Starship and Hot Tuna. They were all intelligent, outspoken, creative, fascinating people and I wanted to communicate that. Throughout the &#x2019;80s I kept up with the musicians and tried to speak with them whenever I could. </p><p>In 1992, I wrote the liner notes for the Airplane's boxed set. I've since written more than 25 liner notes for Airplane CDs, interviewing the musicians each time. With those conversations as a basis, and having established working relationships with all of the major parties involved, I decided it was high time the world had a book on Jefferson Airplane. I&#x2019;ve long felt they were one of the most important American rock bands, one that truly represented the exhilaration, experimentalism and chaos of the 1960s, and one whose gripping, sometimes unbelievable story needed to be told. This book is the result.</p>Jann Wenner, editor-in-chief and publisher of Rolling Stone, wrote, "The classic Jefferson Airplane lineup were both architects and messengers of a psychedelic age, a liberation of mind and body that profoundly changed American art, politics, and spirituality.

Their appearances at the landmark Monterey Pop, Woodstock and Altamont rock festivals&#x2014;the only band to play at all three&#x2014;placed them on the front lines during one of the most exciting, tumultuous times in American history. Their confrontational lyrics and alternative lifestyles often cast them as "outlaws in the eyes of America." Jefferson Airplane didn&#x2019;t just dominate American popular music and culture at the peak of the &#x2019;60s, they transformed it. </p><p>Got a Revolution! is the first full-length biography ever written about Jefferson Airplane. Jeff Tamarkin, veteran music writer and historian, has worked closely with the former members of Jefferson Airplane for more than a decade and penned more than twenty-five Airplane-elated liner notes. Those who lived it tell the story: the band members, their families, friends, lovers, crew members, and fellow musicians. The book&#x2019;s all-star cast includes fellow rock legends David Crosby, Janis Joplin, Donovan, the Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones, and Paul McCartney, to such larger-than-life cultural figures as Robert F. Kennedy, Bill Graham, Abbie Hoffman, the Hell&#x2019;s Angels, and even Richard Nixon. It&#x2019;s a tale of complex people with complex relationships living under the spotlight during a complex time. </p><p>To the public, they were prototypical free-loving, good-time hippies, but to their inner circle, Jefferson Airplane was a paradoxical bunch&#x2014;constantly at odds with one another. Jefferson Airplane&#x2019;s members were each brilliant, individualistic artists who became the living embodiment of the ups and downs of the sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyle.</p></p><h2>World&#39;s Greatest Dad Jokes: 160 Hilarious Knee-Slappers and Puns Dads Love to Tell</h2><p>Laugh with dads, not at them, with these 200 hilariously hokey knee-slappers and puns!<br><br><i>A potato walks into a bar.

(Carmelite Hermit of the Trinity).<br>THE CARMELITE SAINTS in their prayers and reflections reveal a deep communion with the Passion of Jesus. In the light of Christ crucified they beheld the depths of the heart of God and discovered there as well the meaning of the human heart. We cannot reach the thicket of God's riches for which we were created, Saint John of the Cross says, without peering into the thicket of his sufferings.<br> One of the most fruitful practices of Christian piety is known as The Way of the Cross (or Stations of the Cross), a devotion that in all probability dates back to the era of the first Christians. As practiced today, the devotion centers on fourteen chosen representations of the sufferings of Christ on his way to Calvary. Each station or stop is a place for contemplation, a moment to gaze on the sorrowful Christ who remains close to us in the mystery of human suffering. One day while making the Way of the Cross, St. Therese of Lisieux was seized with a forceful love of God and totally plunged in fire and sweetness. Theologians see this grace as of special importance for the transmission of her Little Way. <br>Now we have the opportunity to make the Way of the Cross with five inspiring Carmelite saints. Following along with them Christ in his sufferings, we see that the Passion of Christ cannot be exhausted, and these saints have always more to tell us. This is not a book to be read but once and then discarded, it is a book for a lifetime.

In the first book, Branley explores magnetism and the uses and history of magnets. Several simple experiments allow for hands-on, empirical verification of concepts. The illustrations, the tone of the text, and the device of a helpful mouse add appeal to a subject that may have had a limited audience. The second title, which is complemented by Lloyd's artful renderings, examines camouflage as an animal defense. Each spread shows several creatures blended into their natural environment; all of them are accurately illustrated and clearly identified. The final pages invite readers to take a closer look at the world around them and discover hidden life. These titles are well-designed, written, and illustrated. In both books, the information is relevant and succinct.

More specifically, you ll be using your fingers to pick the individual notes out of common chords to backup your voice instead of strumming or picking those chords with a pick. It s just a kinder, gentler way to play rhythm guitar. Think of Dust in the Wind, "Blackbird," Scarborough Fair, Landslide, Leader of the Band and Time in a Bottle. These are among the songs we ll use to explore this style.<br>Learning the picking patterns themselves (presented in tablature, by the way) is fairly straightforward; the trick is in the coordination of the fretting and picking hands during the transitions from chord to chord. We'll cover a number of principles that help you navigate through these changes without losing the beat.

The Bigfoot story has moved from certainty of the creatures existence to claims of hoaxes, trickery, and outright lies and back again. Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin claim to have taken movies of Bigfoot; Ray Wallace s family shows wooden feet that they claim were used to start the whole Bigfoot story in 1958. Who do we believe?<br><br>The Bords answer is nobody and everybody. The cases are presented without prejudice so you can make up your own mind. Sometimes it s easy, as with the Ray Wallace claims there are plenty of sightings before Ray Wallace was alive to make it clear he didn t start the whole thing. Other cases are a mystery.

The event was recently depicted in the Steven Spielberg movie Bridge of Spies. Powers was captured by the KGB, subjected to a televised show trial, and imprisoned, all of which created an international incident. Soviet authorities eventually released him in exchange for captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. On his return to the United States, Powers was exonerated of any wrongdoing while imprisoned in Russia, yet, due to bad press and the government&#39;s unwillingness to heartily defend Powers, a cloud of controversy lingered until his untimely death in 1977. Now his son, Francis Gary Powers Jr. and acclaimed historian Keith Dunnavant have written this new account of Powers&#39;s life based on personal files that had never been previously available. Delving into old audio tapes, letters his father wrote and received while imprisoned in the Soviet Union, the transcript of his father&#39;s debriefing by the CIA, other recently declassified documents about the U-2 program, and interviews with the spy pilot&#39;s contemporaries, Powers and Dunnavant set the record straight. The result is a fascinating piece of Cold War history. This is also a book about a son&#39;s journey to understand his father, pursuing justice and a measure of peace.Almost sixty years after the fact, this will be the definitive account of one of the most important events of the Cold War.</p><p><b>Francis Gary Powers Jr</b>. is the founder and chairman emeritus of the Cold War Museum, a 501(c) (3) charity in Vint Hill, Virginia, near Washington, DC.

There was love in that moment. There was security.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll never forget the last time we shared this ritual. It was the night before my world shattered.<br><br>In those days, Dad piloted a traffic helicopter for KNBC-TV, the NBC-owned station in Los Angeles. We lived very comfortably in the San Fernando Valley town of Sherman Oaks: father; mother; elder sister, Dee; and me. Life was good.<br><br>The first day of August in 1977 was an ordinary workday for my forty-seven-year-old father, but something went terribly wrong. His helicopter ran out of gas and crashed near a golf course in Encino. When someone from the station came to tell the family about the crash, I was left confused, thinking he must have broken a few bones and probably would be confined to a hospital bed for a few days. No one pulled me aside to reveal the awful truth.<br><br>Later that afternoon, with the house full of people and a somber tone permeating the place, I stood behind several adults in the living room, watching Channel 4&#x2019;s evening newscast. Jess Marlow was a giant in Los Angeles television, the personification of the stone-faced, detached anchorman. Hearing from this iconic figure that my father was dead, at the same time much of Southern California learned the news, was shocking . . . and so was watching him choke up and actually shed a tear on live television. There was no crying on television in those days, but Marlow could not help himself. He had lost a colleague and a friend. I was devastated beyond words. My life would never be the same.<br><br>Several adults went out of their way to comfort me, including another dear family friend, the actor Robert Conrad. At one point, Conrad called me on the telephone and gave me what amounted to a pep talk: &#x201c;Your father was a good man,&#x201d; he said, stressing that, &#x201c;no matter what you might hear,&#x201d; your dad was a patriot who sacrificed greatly for his country.<br><br>&#x201c;Be proud of him. His legacy is now in you. . . .&#x201d;<br><br><i>No matter what I might hear?</i><br><br>I tried to process what Mr. Conrad said, but on the day my father died, I was still too young and too sheltered to fully appreciate the burden associated with being Francis Gary Powers Jr., because I didn&#x2019;t really know my father.

Translated here from the edition of Parv?z N?t?l Kh?nlar?, the 486 poems have been rendered as literally as possible while trying to convey some sense of the original poetry to the reader who lacks knowledge of Persian.

One of today's most eminent Persian scholars, he was for years Lecturer in Persian Studies in the University of Cambridge where he still lives. His works include A translation of The Ruba'iyat Of Omar Khayyam, with poet John Heath-Stubbs, and The Speech of the Birds, the Mantiqu't-tair of Faridu'd Din.</p><h2>Double Header: My Life with Two Penises</h2><p>He was featured on the front pages of RollingStone.com, Jezebel.com and was covered by The Huffington Post. Both Conan O&#39;Brien and Jay Leno featured him in their opening monologues. Countless news agencies around the world broke the story when he went on Reddit and did an Ask Me Anything (AMA). Ranking as the 4th most popular Reddit AMA of all time (beating out the likes of Peter Dinklage, Bill Murray, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Harrison Ford), DoubleDickDude spent 48 hours discussing his life with a genetic condition known as diphallia. Only 1 in 5.5 million males worldwide are born with two penises. However very few (if any) are born with two working, and by all accounts, attractive penises. After having managed to stay under the radar for over 20 years DoubleDickDude (or DDD for short) amassed thousands of followers on Twitter and Tumblr in a matter of hours. In fact Twitter (temporarily) suspended his account for replying to his followers too many times! For the past year he has taken to writing a more lengthy and detailed account of his life so far. Very little could be detailed during a frenzy of questions from thousands on Reddit. DDD goes from discussing his childhood, and explains how he knew he was special at an early age. His parents support grounded him in his early youth. We find out how he lost his virginity and was exposed to his peers. From there he discusses his wild streak of sexual adventures fresh out of high school. Recapping his favorite questions and answers, discussing sexuality and acceptance DDD covers the gamut. Don&#39;t worry, all the saucy and steamy stories he hinted at in his AMA are covered and then some. Like that 7-way orgy he briefly detailed amid the torrent of questions during his AMA. Not to mention the hunky straight gym jock who &#34;went gay&#34; and the poor girl who... shall we say, her lady place was a wreck after one time with DDD. It&#39;s all in there and more! Written from first person perspective the narrative is raw, honest and often times gritty. Details are not spared and readers beware, naughty moments are revealed! The next time you see a man on the street with more than an adequate bulge in his jeans, it might just be DDD.</p><p></p><h2>Come a Stranger (5) (The Tillerman Cycle)</h2><p><b>A dashed dream leads to a rash decision in the fifth installment of Cynthia Voigt&#x2019;s Tillerman cycle.</b><br><br>Mina Smiths lives to dance, so her scholarship to ballet camp seems like a dream come true. She doesn&#x2019;t even mind being the only black girl in the troupe&#x2014;that is, until she is told she&#x2019;ll never be a classical dancer. It&#x2019;s then that Mina begins to face some difficult truths about race and identity and transfers her passion for dance to Tamer Shipp, the summer minister for her church. The problem is, he&#x2019;s a grown man with a family, but she can&#x2019;t stop wishing for more to their friendship than simply pastor and parishioner. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cynthia Voigt&#x2019;s incomparable mastery of character and community shines forth in this stirring novel from her acclaimed Tillerman cycle.</p><p>Cynthia Voigt won the Newbery Medal for <i>Dicey&#x2019;s Song</i>, the Newbery Honor Award for <i>A Solitary Blue</i>, and the National Book Award Honor for <i>Homecoming</i>, all part of the beloved Tillerman cycle. She is also the author of many other celebrated books for middle grade and teen readers, including <i>Izzy, Willy-Nilly</i> and <i>Jackaroo</i>. She was awarded the Margaret A. Edwards Award in 1995 for her work in literature, and the Katahdin Award in 2004. She lives in Maine.Grade 5 Up Mina Smiths, whom many readers will remember from Dicey's Song (Atheneum, 1982), takes center stage in this addition to the Tillerman saga and holds it with energy and spirit. The story takes her from age 10 to 15, following her from a youthful dancer, full of herself and her ambitions, to a wise and realistic young woman. The key to her growth is Tamer Shipp, a young pastor who drives her home from the station once she leaves the dance camp from which she has been dismissed, perhaps because puberty has harmed her talents, perhaps because she is black. When Tamer's honesty and understanding help her through the first pain, she begins to love him, forming a relationship which will be central to her perceptions of the world around her for the ensuing three summers. There is little plot here, but the story moves well, with the theme, Mina's changing view of the world and her place in it as a young black woman, carrying it in a rich current. The events are seen through Mina's eyes, as are the characters who, nonetheless, emerge with strong identities of their own. In the last third of the book, the Tillermans come into focus as Mina learns about Bullet (The Runner Atheneum, 1985) from Tamer, who loved and hated him. It is her relationship with the Tillermans and with Tamer which brings the story to its climax, as Mina finds a way to complete the circle, bringing a measure of peace to all. Voigt tells her story smoothly, getting inside of Mina's perceptions easily and believably. To catch the resonance of the story, it would be helpful to have read the earlier books about the Tillermans, although, except for minor lapses in character description and incident, this does stand well on its own. Voigt permits readers to know her characters in a way they rarely know people in real life.

By early 2003, political dialogue had run its course. Preparations for invasion were nearly complete. American forces were arrayed near Iraq&#x2019;s borders, readying for attack. Their number dwarfed the size of the force in Afghanistan, which had grown to about 10,000 troops. Afghanistan was no longer the priority.

Janni is already splashing around.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in, Daddy!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming, Janni. I just have to finish setting up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look, Janni!&#x201d; Susan calls out. &#x201c;Lynn and the twins are here. Come say hi.&#x201d;<br><br>I look over to the gate where Susan is letting them in. Janni is the same age as the twins. We&#x2019;ve known them since they were babies.<br><br>&#x201c;Janni?&#x201d; Susan calls again to her. &#x201c;Come say hi to Lynn and the twins.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Janni calls back, not even bothering to turn around and see.<br><br>&#x201c;Janni, you have to welcome your guests,&#x201d; Susan says, a bit more sternly.<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Janni yells behind her, more forcefully this time.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, January!&#x201d; Lynn calls. &#x201c;Happy birthday!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not January!&#x201d; Janni screams, still not turning around. Then calmly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Blue-Eyed Tree Frog.&#x201d;<br><br>Lynn is visibly taken aback a little, but recovers quickly; she&#x2019;s known our struggle with Janni&#x2019;s constant name changing for a while now.<br><br>A year ago, Janni stopped going by her name. And this phase has gone on way longer than we thought it would. Whenever someone calls her by her real name, she screams like somebody put her hand to a hot frying pan.<br><br>We don&#x2019;t even try to force her to use her given name. At this point we&#x2019;re happy if she just picks one name and sticks with it. The problem is that she changes it all the time, sometimes multiple times in the same day. She&#x2019;s been &#x201c;Hot Dog,&#x201d; &#x201c;Rainbow,&#x201d; &#x201c;Firefly,&#x201d; and now &#x201c;Blue-Eyed Tree Frog,&#x201d; which was originally &#x201c;Red-Eyed Tree Frog,&#x201d; from Go Diego! Go!, until a lady working at Sav-On drugstore pointed out, &#x201c;But you have blue eyes, dear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lynn and the girls have come to your birthday party,&#x201d; Susan reminds her. &#x201c;You need to come and greet them.&#x201d;<br><br>Janni gets out of the pool and comes over to the twins. She is not pouting. She is smiling and rubbing her hands rapidly, as if she is actually suddenly happy to see them. It&#x2019;s like the previous outburst never happened.<br><br>Susan gets the twins two juice boxes from the cooler.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Janni. How are you?&#x201d; Lynn asks pleasantly.<br><br>The hand rubbing stops and the smile vanishes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not Janni! I&#x2019;m Blue-Eyed Tree Frog.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry. I forgot.&#x201d; Lynn quickly corrects herself like she just received a mild electric shock.<br><br>&#x201c;Girls, wish Blue-Eyed Tree Frog a happy birthday,&#x201d; Lynn instructs her daughters.<br><br>&#x201c;Happy birthday, Janni,&#x201d; they dutifully intone. The twins have known my daughter as Janni since before they could talk. It is all they know.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not Janni!&#x201d; she screams at the twins. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Blue-Eyed Tree Frog.&#x201d;<br><br>The twins look up at their mom, confused.<br><br>&#x201c;Janni!&#x201d; Susan warns. &#x201c;Be polite.&#x201d;<br><br>I say nothing. Sure, I would like Janni to be polite, but I realize odd behavior is a by-product of her genius. She hit all of her developmental markers early and was already talking at eight months. By thirteen months she knew all her letters, both big and small, even if they were turned on their side or upside down. Then, at eighteen months, she was speaking in grammatically correct sentences, introducing herself to people saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Janni Paige and I am eighteen months old.&#x201d;<br><br>But I didn&#x2019;t fully comprehend what she was capable of until I came back from grad school one evening when Janni was two and Susan was telling me about their day.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been teaching her addition,&#x201d; Susan told me, which I already knew, &#x201c;so today we started on subtraction. I asked her what &#x2018;seven minus four&#x2019; was.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did she get it right?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, she did, so we did &#x2018;seven minus three is four.&#x2019; Then she asks me, &#x2018;Mommy, what&#x2019;s four minus seven?&#x2019; so I started trying to explain negative numbers to her.&#x201d;<br><br>I stare at Susan. &#x201c;She asked you what was four minus seven?&#x201d;<br><br>Susan, washing dishes, turns to me. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; She sees the look of shock on my face. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She asked you that right out of the blue?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>Negative numbers, I remember thinking. Negative numbers are a totally abstract concept because they don&#x2019;t exist in the real world. You can&#x2019;t see negative four apples. At two years old, Janni&#x2019;s mind made the jump from what Piaget called &#x201c;concrete reasoning&#x201d; to &#x201c;abstract reasoning,&#x201d; something that typically happens at a much older age. Janni could conceive of concepts that did not actually physically exist.<br><br>I have fantasies of Janni going to Harvard or Yale or MIT before she is even a teenager. My ultimate dream, when I close my eyes at night, is Janni winning the Nobel Prize. For what, I don&#x2019;t know and don&#x2019;t really care. But to be able to do what she can do at two years old, she must be a gift to humanity. I think that trumps being impolite on occasion.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you like some juice?&#x201d; Susan hands the twins the juice boxes and they take them.<br><br>Janni starts to laugh and flings her arm around the twins. &#x201c;400 is splashing mango juice on you,&#x201d; she chortles, without touching them.<br><br>The girls flinch instinctively, then look up at their mother for guidance, not sure what happened.<br><br>&#x201c;400 is splashing mango juice on you.&#x201d; Janni makes the move again like she is throwing juice on the twins, but she has nothing in her hand.<br><br>The twins retreat to either side of their mother.<br><br>&#x201c;Janni, that isn&#x2019;t nice,&#x201d; Susan corrects.<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not me. It&#x2019;s 400. 400 is splashing mango juice on them. She likes to splash mango juice on people.&#x201d; Her arm shoots out with the imaginary juice again. We don&#x2019;t even have mango juice.<br><br>The twins look up at Lynn. &#x201c;You both need sunscreen.&#x201d; She looks down at them, taking each daughter in one hand and over to the lounge chairs and tables.<br><br>&#x201c;Well then, tell 400 to stop,&#x201d; Susan tells Janni. &#x201c;400 is another one of her imaginary friends,&#x201d; she explains to Lynn.<br><br>Janni turns away and says to the air, &#x201c;400, stop that.&#x201d; She waits, apparently for a response, before turning back to the twins.<br><br>&#x201c;She won&#x2019;t stop.&#x201d; Janni breaks into laughter again. &#x201c;It is so funny. 400 is throwing mango juice on you.&#x201d;<br><br>The twins are clearly scared, as Lynn puts on their sunscreen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, we know Janni is &#x2018;unique.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>This is frustrating. She&#x2019;s being imaginative, but the twins haven&#x2019;t seen imagination like this. Geniuses are often eccentric, I think to myself.<br><br>&#x201c;Janni!&#x201d; Susan&#x2019;s voice goes up an octave. &#x201c;Stop it!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not me! It&#x2019;s 400!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You control 400. Tell her to stop.&#x201d;<br><br>Janni puts out her hands in exasperation. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Janni . . . ,&#x201d; Susan begins, but I cut her off.<br><br>&#x201c;Let it go.&#x201d;<br><br>Janni comes over to me and and we get ready to go into the pool. This is what I do. I am her protector from the rest of the world.<br><br>I see the look of frustration on Susan&#x2019;s face, but she doesn&#x2019;t completely understand Janni like I do.<br><br>&#x201c;She needs to greet her friends,&#x201d; she tells me imploringly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not helping her learn to be polite.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s her birthday. Let it go,&#x201d; I reply.<br><br>Susan opens her mouth to protest.<br><br>&#x201c;Let it go,&#x201d; I say again, more firmly. Susan closes her mouth and gives me an annoyed look.<br><br>I jump in the water and come up to the edge, holding out my arms. &#x201c;Come on, Janni. Jump to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;400 wants to jump in, too,&#x201d; Janni says earnestly.<br><br>&#x201c;Cats don&#x2019;t generally like water.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, you stay here, 400.&#x201d;<br><br>Janni jumps to me, and I carry her out into the middle of the pool. Janni suddenly looks back at the edge.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, no! 400 fell in the pool!&#x201d; she cries out. &#x201c;400, don&#x2019;t drown!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got 400,&#x201d; I answer. I put Janni down in the shallow end and wade over to where I imagine 400 to be. This is what I do that makes me different from everybody else in Janni&#x2019;s life. I play along with her imaginary friends like they are real. I&#x2019;ll be damned if I&#x2019;m going to get lumped in with the &#x201c;thirteens&#x201d; in her mind. Janni says &#x201c;thirteens&#x201d; are kids and adults who don&#x2019;t have her imagination. She considers herself a &#x201c;twenty,&#x201d; like me, and Susan a &#x201c;seventeen,&#x201d; while most of her friends are &#x201c;fifteens.&#x201d; But the &#x201c;thirteens&#x201d; have no imagination at all.<br><br>&#x201c;Got her!&#x201d; I fish nothing out of the water. &#x201c;Ah! Now she is on my head! 400!&#x201d; I pretend to sink under the weight of the imaginary cat. I will not shut any aspect of Janni down. I will not restrict anything, because I worry once she shuts down in order to conform, her full potential might be lost.<br><br>Janni smiles and laughs.<br><br>&#x201c;400! Get off Daddy&#x2019;s head.&#x201d;<br><br>I smile back, happy.<br><br>&#x201c;You know, Janni, if you could find an ocean big enough to put Saturn in it, it would float.&#x201d; This is how I teach her. I engage her imaginary friends and then she pays attention.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember what the atmospheric pressure on Venus is?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ninety,&#x201d; Janni answers.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. You would weigh ninety times what you weigh on Earth. Of course, if we were on Venus right now, we&#x2019;d be swimming in sulfuric acid. And then there is the heat. Venus is hotter than Mercury, even though Mercury is closer to the sun, about eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It gets up to two hundred degrees in Calilini,&#x201d; Janni says.<br><br>Here is my chance to insert a little reality into her world.<br><br>&#x201c;Janni, that&#x2019;s hotter than any place on Earth. That&#x2019;s nearly the boiling point of water. Nothing could survive that temperature.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My friends do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not possible. Our bodies are mostly made of water, and at that temperature we would literally start to boil. How can they possibly survive?&#x201d;<br><br>Janni shrugs. &#x201c;They do.&#x201d;<br><br>I open my mouth, ready to continue arguing the illogic of this, but Janni is drifting away from me so I let it drop.<br><br>&#x201c;Janni,&#x201d; I call.<br><br>She turns around.<br><br>&#x201c;I still have a cat on my head.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiles.<br><br>I am looking at the pizza boxes on the table.<br><br>Last year, I ordered six medium cheese pizzas and we ran out before all the guests had even arrived, so Susan wanted me to order nine this time. I did, except that now six of them sit still unopened.<br><br>Susan comes over and tells me it is time to do the cake.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you told everybody to sing &#x2018;Happy Birthday&#x2019; to Blue-Eyed Tree Frog?&#x201d; I ask her.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I have,&#x201d; Susan replies, knowing my fear and hers. The last thing we both want is Janni flipping out on her birthday. &#x201c;Hopefully, people will remember.&#x201d; She turns and calls out that it is time to light the candles.<br><br>Everybody gathers around the cake, which even says, happy birthday, blue-eyed tree frog.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, you ready?&#x201d; Susan asks me.<br><br>I light the candles. Janni stands between us, rubbing her hands at a speed so fast it looks like it must be painful on her wrists, but she shows no discomfort.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay . . . ,&#x201d; Susan begins. &#x201c;Happy birthday to you . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Everybody sings along. &#x201c;Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Susan looks at me, nervously.<br><br>I sing &#x201c;. . . Blue Eyed Tree Frog&#x201d; at the top of my lungs, trying to lead the guests in the correct name and cut off any &#x201c;mistakes&#x201d; before Janni can hear them.<br><br>&#x201c;Happy birthday to you!&#x201d;<br><br>Everybody claps, including Janni. I look up at Susan and see her exhaling with relief, as I am.<br><br>As Susan serves the cake, I realize it is a smaller group this year. I&#x2019;ve been paying attention to Janni, playing with her because she won&#x2019;t play with anyone else, and didn&#x2019;t notice. That explains the pizza situation. Last year people stayed for hours, long after the cake and the presents. This year, some have already left. Looking around, I realize that Lynn and the twins are gone, too.<br><br>-- Michael S.

Andre Gregory is an intense, highly experimental theater director and playwright in search of life&#39;s meanings and spiritual revelations. His friend, Wally Shawn, is an actor and playwright living in New York who is more preoccupied with the search for his next meal. As Andre recounts his global journeys involving esoteric theatrical experiments and mystical adventures, Wally listens with more than skepticism, as his attitudes shift among wonder, puzzlement, admiration, and anger. What finally emerges is a sensitive portrait of a friendship that survives and transcends contransting assumptions about love, death, art, and man&#39;s continuing quest for self-fulfillment.</p><p></p><h2>On the Internet: Our First Talk About Online Safety (The World Around Us, 3)</h2><p><i>On the Internet: Our First Talk About Online Safety</i> introduces children to the basics of online safety in a story-based, conversational style.

Lyrical passages in her wolf pup diary describe how the pups tumble and play and when they first learn to howl and talk wolk talk. Readers are reminded of the changes in nature that are happening in the lower 48 states as they "look to the north" to watch the wolf pups grow. Jean George's words and Lucia Washburn's breathtaking paintings give the reader a rare glimpse of one of nature's noblest creatures: the wolf.</p></p><p><p>Jean Craighead George wrote over one hundred books for children and young adults. Her novel <em>Julie of the</em> <em>Wolves</em> won the Newbery Medal in 1973, and she received a 1960 Newbery Honor for <em>My Side of the Mountain</em>. She continued to write acclaimed picture books that celebrate the natural world. Her other books with Wendell Minor include <em>The Wolves Are Back</em>; <em>Luck</em>; <em>Everglades</em>; <em>Arctic Son</em>; <em>Morning, Noon, and Night</em>; and <em>Galapagos George</em>.</p><br><br><p>Lucia Washburn has illustrated more than a dozen books for children. Her Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science books include <em>Dinosaur Tracks</em>, <em>Dinosaurs Big and Small</em>, and <em>Did Dinosaurs Have Feathers?</em>, which has illustrations that "provide vivid visualizations of long-ago landscapes" (<em>School Library Journal</em>). Her other books include <em>Look to the North</em> by Jean Craighead George, a 1997 Parents' Choice Gold Award winner praised as "a fine addition to science collections" (ALA <em>Booklist</em>). When she travels, she and her family enjoy visiting the local museums to see their dinosaur collections. Being the mother of two children, she has a special fondness for <em>Maiasaura</em>. She lives in California with her family.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3. George uses a journal approach to illuminate the first 10+ months of life for three wolf pups born to an alpine tundra pack. Each entry in the "diary" is prefaced with a message (in colored inks) to readers/listeners living south of the area telling them how to keep "tundra-time" in the framework of their own seasons. "When you see dandelions turning silver...." "When the yellow warblers return...." "When you are eating fresh blueberries...." Then, George writes, "Look to the north" and in the following paragraph(s), she describes the pups, their gradual development, and their environment. The lyrical text is accompanied by large, realistic acrylic paintings of the adult wolves, the pups, and their habitat along with small cameos of the southern reminders?a clump of dandelions, a yellow warbler (the illustrator should consult a Peterson guide), ripe blueberries, etc. The author's research is impeccable, and her affection for her subject evident, affirmed in a personal note. Children will take pleasure in the simply worded narrative and the warm pictures, and will store some accurate wolf data in their memories, as well as take stronger note of their own habitats as they keep an eye out for dandelions, for fresh blueberries on the table, and for Halloween jack-o-lanterns on front porches.?Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Revenge of the Witch (Last Apprentice, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>Capturing witches<br>Binding boggarts<br>Driving away ghosts</strong></p><p>For years, Old Gregory has been the Spook for the county, ridding the local villages of evil. Now his time is coming to an end. But who will take over for him? Twenty-nine apprentices have tried&#x2013;some floundered, some fled, some failed to stay alive.</p><p>Only Thomas Ward is left. He's the last hope; the last apprentice.</p><p>Can Thomas succeed? Will he learn the difference between a benign witch and a malevolent one? Does the Spook's warning against girls with pointy shoes include Alice? And what will happen if Thomas accidentally frees Mother Malkin, the most evil witch in the county ... ?</p></p><p>"I was going to learn how to protect farms and villages from things that go bump in the night. Dealing with ghouls, boggarts, and all manner of wicked beasties would be all in a day's work. That's what the Spook did, and I was going to be his apprentice." Twelve-year-old Thomas Ward, as the seventh son of a seventh son, has no inheritance and is bored with farm work, and even though his new job will mean the superstitious villagers will forever shun him, he is eager to go off to adventure with the tall, hooded man he calls the Spook. His mother, a magical person herself, approves, and the Spook's teaching is strict but kind. But when Tom has only learned enough to be able to control their house-boggart, he is tricked by Alice, the young daughter of a witch family, into inadvertently releasing and then killing Mother Malkin, a witch the Spook has imprisoned in a pit. This is no polite wicca-type witch, but a snuffling, slime-trailing, cannibalistic creature reminiscent of Tolkien's nasgils. The story of Tom's escape from the reincarnated witch's hideous revenge is full of horrible details, as Alice helps, and then once again betrays him. This well-crafted novel marks an auspicious start for an exciting and fast series for young teens.

You'll discover strategies for:<br><br>-Identifying the leap-of-faith assumptions hidden in your plan<br><br>-Testing those assumptions and unearthing why the plan might not work<br><br>-Reconfiguring the five components of your business model-revenue model, gross margin model, operating model, working capital model, and investment model-to create a sounder Plan B.<br><br>Filled with success stories and cautionary tales, this book offers real cases illustrating the authors' unique process.

The number of reported cases has doubled in last decade and the infection scale has become larger than HIV. Aside from hepatitis C, Lyme Disease may be the second largest infectious disease in this country. Worldwide, it is also rapidly spreading in Canada, Europe, and Asia. There is great controversy concerning the diagnosis, treatments, and prognosis of Lyme disease, especially regarding the chronic and persistent form. This controversy has often left chronically infected patients without adequate medical care. Due to the special features of the Lyme spirochete and its multiple co-infections, conventional Western antibiotics treatments have not proven to be very effective. Stand-alone antibiotics treatment has become less effective overtime due to increased resistance and adaptation of germs. The Western medical approach to this infectious disease is to focus only on killing the pathogen. It does not address the complexities of the Lyme pathogenesis and various associated complications in chronic infections. Modern Chinese medicine is an integration of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. We use this integrative system for the treatment of chronic Lyme disease. With over a decade of practical clinical experience, we have found that modern Chinese herbal treatment with supplemental acupuncture applied to Lyme disease (especially its auto-immunity and immune complex related complications) yields a much better clinical outcome than the conventional stand-alone antibiotics approach. What is modern Chinese herbology and how does its phytopharmacology match with the pathophysiology of Lyme disease? What are the shortcomings of conventional Western approach in treating chronic Lyme disease? How does MCM treat Lyme disease with herbal remedies and what are the phytopharmacology of these herbal remedies? This book is a comprehensive discussion about traditional and Modern Chinese Medicine and aims to answer these questions in detail.</p><p>About the Author &#x2013; Dr. Qingcai Zhang Following graduation from Shanghai Second Medical University in 1962, Dr. Qingcai Zhang worked as a physician at the Medical University&#x2019;s Reijing Hospital, conducting clinical and laboratory research to integrate Chinese and Western medicine.

Today, organ transplants are common miracles of science. But if the supply cannot meet the demand, how far will people go to find donors? Dr. Laurie Montgomery, a forensic pathologist, learns the terrifying answer when she investigates a series of fatal "overdose" of young professionals. Some crimes are beyond comprehension. But seeing is believing...<p>* A Literary Guild? Dual Selection</p></p><p><b>Robin Cook, M.D.,</b> is the author of more than thirty books and is credited with popularizing the medical thriller with his wildly successful first novel, <i>Coma</i>. He divides his time among Florida, New Hampshire, and Boston. His most recent novels include <i>Host</i>, <i>Cell</i>, and <i>Nano</i>.An ironically revealing title for ophthalmologist Cook's fuzziest novel in years--an awesomely inept medical/crime thriller about a forensic pathologist up against the mob. As the story opens, the mind of one Duncan Andrews is ``racing like a runaway train,'' his lethargy having ``evaporated like a drip of water falling onto a sizzling skillet.'' Hours and several more clich&#x201a;s later, the ``Wall Street whiz kid'' is dead of a cocaine overdose and lying on the autopsy table of generic Cook heroine (young, spunky, pretty doc) Laurie Montgomery, an N.Y.C. medical examiner. Days and several more dead yuppies later, Laurie is convinced that someone is flooding the upscale market with bad cocaine. Of course, no one will listen to her--not her boss, who wants to chill this political hot potato; not silver-tongued, gold- plated ophthalmologist Jordan Scheffield, who's wooing her with limos and swank dinners; not cop Lou Soldano (``a bit like Colombo''), to whom Laurie explains the exact difference between ophthalmologists, optometrists, and opticians and who wants to woo her with his sedan and spaghetti but can't match Jordan's glitz and anyway is busy worrying about the mob-related corpses stacking up next to the yuppies in Laurie's morgue. For meanwhile, in scenes stiff with clich&#x201a;, two mobsters are blowing away a seemingly random group of citizens on orders from mob kingpin Paul Cerino, who, Laurie learns, is one of Jordan's patients--and who deals coke. Laurie sleuths; the mobsters lock her in a coffin; Laurie sobs; the mobsters let her out; Laurie remembers the flammable properties of ethylene, handily within reach, and blows up the mobsters. Finally, Laurie dumps Jordan for Lou, and she and the cop talk about the motives behind the whole ``horrid affair''--which owe more than a little to Coma. A slack and ragged retread, with Cook parodying himself in a tale that's about as stylish and suspenseful as an eye-chart.

She knows it's high time to make an inventory of her household and its valuables, but she finds that cataloging the family belongings--as well as their misfortunes--won't contain her family's secrets, not when her wayward sister suddenly returns, determined to expose skeletons the Kratts had hoped to take to their graves.<br><br>Interweaving the present with chilling flashbacks from one fateful evening in 1929, Judith pieces together the influence of her family on their small South Carolina cotton town, learning that the devastating effects of dark family secrets can last a lifetime and beyond.</p><p>Andrea Bobotis is the author of the debut novel <i>The Last List of Miss Judith Kratt</i>,&nbsp;forthcoming from Sourcebooks in July 2019.

Written at the end of Chrysostom's life, while he was in his final exile, we see in these pages the unshaken faith of a saint who triumphed over persecution.

The letters by John to Olympia are landmark testaments to affinities and friendships that weather the storms of their time. The ending is not, at one level, pleasant. John died in exile, Olympia died a year later. It is the faithfulness of John and Olympia in the midst of demanding struggles and many a disappointment that shines through in these letters and makes this a burnished gold book. Do read and inwardly digest this bounty of a correspondence. The faith journey will have much more integrity as a result of sitting with these two all too human saints of the church. Many thanks, of course, to David Ford, for his yeoman s labour in bringing forth a much neglected correspondence.

The show was featuring dog sled races during a yearly Canadian Trappers&#x2019; Carnival.

Svenson, a prolific yet somewhat anonymous, writer of books for children. Jerry West was the pen name assigned to Svenson when he started writing The Happy Hollisters for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book packager well-known for its development of children's book series including Tom Swift, The Bobbsey Twins, The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew. Many of these series were intended to have long publishing lives, and were written by multiple authors using the same pseudonym. The Happy Hollisters, however, were all written by Andrew Svenson, whose identity as Jerry West was kept secret until several years after his death in 1975. Andrew Svenson was born in Belleville, NJ, in 1910, and his interest in writing started early. He was editor of his high school newspaper and yearbook at Barringer High School in Newark, and then went on to study Creative Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. After his graduation in 1932, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Newark Star Eagle and the Newark Evening News. During this time, Andrew Svenson was encouraged by his friend and co-worker Howard Garis (author of Uncle Wiggily) to try his hand at juvenile fiction. Svenson joined the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1948, where he contributed to established series as Franklin W. Dixon (The Hardy Boys) and as Laura Lee Hope (The Bobbsey Twins). The first volume in The Happy Hollisters was published in 1953 by Doubleday &amp; Company, and he was made a partner in the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1961. As he wrote and developed 33 titles in The Happy Hollisters, he was also creating additional series for children under other pen names: Bret King by Dan Scott and The Tollivers by Alan Stone, the first series written for and about African-American children. Andrew Svenson wrote more than 70 adventure and mystery novels for children, which were published in 17 languages and sold millions of copies. The Hollister family was modeled on his own family and he often used Svenson family events and travels as the foundation for The Happy Hollisters books. He also kept copious newspaper clippings for story ideas, and interviewed hundreds of school children and teachers for additional suggestions. These ideas were worked into his storylines, adding an educational element that was appreciated by parents and educators alike. Children loved the books for their elements of danger and excitement geared to their comprehension level.</p><h2>American Birding Association Field Guide to Birds of Pennsylvania (American Birding Association State Field)</h2><p>Pennsylvania is one of the best places to go birding in North America.

But it drives home Yuri Slezkine&#x2019;s provocative thesis: Jews have adapted to the modern world so well that they have become models of what it means to be modern.

In extensive interviews given to researchers from Boston College, Brendan Hughes and David Ervine spoke with astonishing openness about their turbulent, violent lives. <br>Hughes was a legend in the Republican movement. An 'operator', a gun-runner and mastermind of some of the most savage IRA violence of the Troubles, he was a friend and close ally of Gerry Adams and was by his side during the most brutal years of the conflict. <br>David Ervine was the most substantial political figure to emerge from the world of Loyalist paramilitaries. A former Ulster Volunteer Force bomber and confidante of its long-time leader Gusty Spence, Ervine helped steer Loyalism's gunmen towards peace, persuading the UVF's leaders to target IRA and Sinn Fein activists and push them down the road to a ceasefire. <br>Now their stories have been woven into a vivid narrative which provides compelling insight into a secret world and events long hidden from history.</p><p><b>Ed Moloney</b> is the author of <i>A Secret History of the IRA</i> and a former Northern Ireland editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> and <i>Sunday Tribune</i>.

He charts the industrialization of animation in the early twentieth century, its representation in the cartoons themselves, and how important blackface minstrels were to that performance, standing in for the frustrations of animation workers. Cherished cartoon characters, such as Mickey Mouse and Felix the Cat, were conceived and developed using blackface minstrelsy's visual and performative conventions: these characters are not like minstrels; they are minstrels. They play out the social, cultural, political, and racial anxieties and desires that link race to the laboring body, just as live minstrel show performers did. Carefully examining how early animation helped to naturalize virulent racial formations, Sammond explores how cartoons used laughter and sentimentality to make those stereotypes seem not only less cruel, but actually pleasurable. Although the visible links between cartoon characters and the minstrel stage faded long ago, Sammond shows how important those links are to thinking about animation then and now, and about how cartoons continue to help to illuminate the central place of race in American cultural and social life.</p><p>Nicholas Sammond is Associate Professor of Cinema Studies at the University of Toronto. He is the author of<i> Babes in Tomorrowland: Walt Disney and the Making of the American Child, 1930-60</i>, and the editor of <i>Steel Chair to the Head: Essays on Professional Wrestling</i>, both also published by Duke University Press.<br>"This is a truly foundational book, explaining how blackface minstrelsy is central to the representational practices, industrial systems, and technologies of animation. <i>The Birth of an Industry</i> analyzes cinema and race through the lenses of labor and aesthetics, and the elegant and scrupulous historiographic practice serves as an example to scholars working in any number of fields. Nicholas Sammond has made an immediate and lasting contribution to our understanding of the peculiar symbiosis of race and cinema, and to its particular relevance to the animated film."<br> (Eric Smoodin, author of <i>Regarding Frank Capra: Audience, Celebrity, and American Film Studies</i>)<br><br>"Welcome to an X-ray of Toontown, its Bones showing.&nbsp; Minstrelsy has sometimes seemed the skeleton in the closet of American animation, its racist tar coons hiding inside our most beloved cartoons&#x2014;Felix, Mickey, Bugs, Daffy, and a host of others both before and after them.&nbsp; With sweeping erudition and definitive archival and theoretical diagnoses, Nicholas Sammond shows just how pervasively blackface figurations have formed the backbone of our animated fantasy lives.

When their simple swamp existence is threatened by development, Charlie decides to fight back.</p><p>A native of Mendenhall, Mississippi, Patrick Smith earned both a B.A. and a master's degree in English from the University of Mississippi. He moved to Florida in 1966 and began writing the novels about Florida that would make bring him lifelong recognition: The River Is Home, The Beginning, Forever Island, Angel City, Allapattah, and A Land Remembered. Smith has been nominated three times for the Pulitzer Prize: in 1973 for Forever Island, which was a 1974 selection of Reader's Digest Condensed Books; in 1978 for Angel City, which was produced as a movie of the week for the CBS television network; and in 1984 for A Land Remembered, which was an Editors' Choice selection of the New York Times Book Review. In the annual statewide Best of Florida poll conducted by Florida Monthly Magazine, A Land Remembered has been ranked #1 Best Florida Book eight times. In 1985 Smith's lifetime work was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1999 he was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame, which is the highest cultural honor bestowed by the state of Florida. In May 2002 Smith was the recipient of the Florida Historical Society's Fay Schweim Award as the &#x201c;Greatest Living Floridian.&#x201d; The one-time-only award was established to honor the one individual who has contributed the most to Florida in recent history. Additionally, Smith earned the 2012 Florida Lifetime Achievement Award for Writing presented by the Florida Humanities Council. The judges felt that &#x201c;Patrick Smith's books have been hugely significant to the citizens of Florida . . . [and] that A Land Remembered is an iconic Florida book that has resonated with generations of Floridians in helping people understand the history of this remarkable state.&#x201d;"Warm, human, and to the point of some men's greedy need to overrun the natural world." --"Publishers Weekly"<br><br>Warm, human, and to the point of some men s greedy need to overrun the natural world. <i>Publishers Weekly</i>"</p><h2>Your Grandparents are Ninjas (Choose Your Own Adventure - Dragonlarks)</h2><p><p> <strong>Your Grandparents Are Ninjas</strong> by Anson Montgomery takes YOU on a daring adventure with your grandma and grandpa, who aren't exactly as they seem!

The result was the 1922 book <i>American Individualism</i>. In it, Hoover expounded and vigorously defended what has come to be called American exceptionalism: the set of beliefs and values that still makes America unique. He argued that America can make steady, sure progress if we preserve our individualism, preserve and stimulate the initiative of our people, insist on and maintain the safeguards to equality of opportunity, and honor service as a part of our national character. <i>American Individualism</i> asserts that equal opportunity for individuals to develop their abilities is &#x201c;the sole source of progress&#x201d; and the fundamental impulse behind American civilization for three&#x2014;now four&#x2014;centuries. More than ninety years have passed since this book was first published; it is clear, in retrospect, that the volume was partly motivated by the political controversies of the time. But <i>American Individualism </i>is not simply a product of a dim and receding past. To a considerable degree the ideological battles of Hoover&#x2019;s era are the battles of our own, and the interpretations we make of our past&#x2014;particularly the years between 1921 and 1933&#x2014;will mold our perspective on the crises of the present.</p><p><b>Herbert Hoover </b>was the thirty-first president of the United States, from 1929 to 1933.

She lives outside of San Francisco.<b> 1 </b><br> <br><b>The Racket Begins with a Jacket</b><br><br>If you took 1,500 one-dollar bills and laid them end to end, they would stretch all of 750 feet. That gets you only three-quarters of the way down a crosstown block in Manhattan. We had to stretch those dollars into a lifetime&#x2014;a lifetime free of ever having to work for anyone other than ourselves again.<br> <br>I was a writer in my early thirties, and Patricia, several years younger, an artist. Newly in love, not wanting to be apart for a second, we itched to travel and see the world. That was never going to be possible if we continued to live month to month. We had met at the <i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> where I worked as a reporter and Patricia as an illustrator and courtroom artist. The <i>Chronicle</i> job served up some stimulating opportunities for a young reporter in the 1970s, and I jumped and cajoled my way into as many as I could. I wrote several stories exposing notorious cult leaders (and questionable gurus such as Werner Erhard, the founder of est) then flourishing in San Francisco&#x2019;s fertile permissiveness, covered the charismatic philosopher Alan Watts&#x2019;s Zen funeral and the Patty Hearst kidnapping by a strange group called the Symbionese Liberation Army, interviewed Andy Warhol and other cultural icons, and wrote the first profile on California&#x2019;s eccentric new young Zen-spouting governor named Jerry Brown. Even so, many of my best ideas were rejected by editors for reasons that had nothing to do with the quality of the idea. Budget, for instance. As the joke went, a notoriously stingy management considered venturing across the Bay Bridge to Oakland to be an out-of-town story subject to layers of approvals. A union shop&#x2014;every reporter hired was required to join and pay dues&#x2014;the prevailing mentality in the city room favored seniority over initiative. Plum assignments went to tired old-timers who hacked out stories between swills of Jack Daniel&#x2019;s at Hanno&#x2019;s, the dive in the alley behind the Chronicle Building. If I happened to sneak a good story past the city editor and into the paper one day, I was punished the next day by being handed a pile of obituaries to write. I knew I had to get out of there.<br><br>It was an eventful time in San Francisco, and working at the <i>Chronicle</i> was exciting. I&#x2019;d jump on the cable car to work, and many long nights would be spent in lively conversation with our colleagues and politicos at the Washington Square Bar and Grill, the North Beach media hangout. As a sketch artist in 1975 and 1976, I was assigned to cover the trial of Patty Hearst, the kidnapped newspaper heiress turned bank robber, and the trial of Sara Jane Moore, for the attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford. Thrilling as it was to see my work published on page one the morning after I sketched it, there was much downtime between such assignments and a lot of grousing from our colleagues about management, wages, and one another. Of the fifty or sixty people working in the city room, many of them our friends, most had been there considerably longer than we had&#x2014;some even for twenty or thirty years. Not going to happen to us, we adamantly agreed. I started taking on freelance magazine assignments to fill the lulls, hoping I could soon be able to live on this work alone, trading in the day job for what appeared to be freedom.<br> <br>One day I came home from work and shot Mel a playful I&#x2019;ve-got-something-to-tell-you look. He had returned from an earlier shift and was on the couch reading.<br> <br>Looking up, he asked, &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess what?&#x201d; I could not wait to tell him. &#x201c;I just quit!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; he replied impishly. &#x201c;I was going to surprise <i>you</i>&#x2014;so did I.&#x201d;<br> <br>We were counting on freelance magazine assignments to tide us over until we figured out what to do. First we downsized, moving from our two-floor San Francisco apartment on Russian Hill to a two-bedroom house off Highway 1 in Mill Valley. The cars whizzed by at night, their headlights penetrating our blinds and invading our sleep. Magazine stories paid well but were irregular. Mimicking our moods, Indian summer gave way to a particularly long, cold, and rainy winter. The rough-sawn redwood interior walls of our rented house kept the days dark. We knew we had to find a way out. While many of our journalist colleagues had invested their union salaries in Marin County houses when they were selling for less than six figures, we were barely making the rent.<br> <br>We weren&#x2019;t panicking&#x2014;we were too young and optimistic for that. We were interested in money only so it could buy us the freedom to paint, write, and travel. We didn&#x2019;t spend much. Our entertainments were hiking, biking, reading, and home-cooked meals with friends. Mel drove an old, beat-up Volkswagen, and I, an old Datsun. Even our cats were frugal, living off the local birds for their meals. We didn&#x2019;t dream about a &#x201c;someday&#x201d; with a house, children, and vacations in Hawaii. We viewed the future as one big, mysterious, open-ended possibility, which was what we had wanted, but our new circumstances were beginning to crimp. Freelancing, it became clear, wasn&#x2019;t so free.<br> <br>Mel came home from the library one afternoon with a copy of Napoleon Hill&#x2019;s <i>Think and Grow Rich</i> and tossed it to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe this is what we need to do,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>The book prompted three basic questions: How much money do I want to make? How long do I give myself to make it? How will I make it?<br> <br>We wrote down our answers separately and compared them. We had both scribbled &#x201c;a million&#x201d; and &#x201c;five years.&#x201d; In 1978, $1 million was a number that any twentysomething middle-class American might have dreamed of making. Five years was the longest period we could envision. That both of us had come up with the same number and time frame validated our answers. Then we each looked at what the other had jotted down as an answer to the &#x201c;how&#x201d; question. Again, the same: &#x201c;start a business.&#x201d;<br> <br>But what business?<br> <br>Several rainy days later, we had yet to find a business idea. The phone rang with a welcome magazine assignment for Mel to explore Australia with several other journalists. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably just a junket,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;ll pay a couple of months&#x2019; rent.&#x201d; While Mel went off to the sunny Southern Hemisphere, I braved the next few weeks home alone finishing up my local fashion column and putting the final touches on a magazine assignment about mail-order clothing.<br><br>Toward the end of the Australian junket, I wandered off one day into the backstreets of Sydney and stumbled on a &#x201c;disposal store,&#x201d; which is what Australians call their surplus stores. I had been drawn to military surplus clothing since my days as a college student in the 1960s. Like others of my generation, I liked to wear surplus clothing because it was cheap. I also got a tickle from the paradox of being stridently antiwar yet happy to attire myself in military detritus. Until I stepped into the Sydney disposal store that day, most of the surplus I&#x2019;d seen was originally issued to American soldiers. I was thrilled to find for the first time other surplus from Australia, Britain, France, and elsewhere. One item especially caught my fancy: a British Burma jacket. Made of thick but soft khaki cotton twill, it looked like a safari jacket. It had the tailored feeling of a fine garment. I had to have it, if only to wear it when I landed in San Francisco the following day. I wanted to see Patricia&#x2019;s reaction.<br> <br>Patricia had exquisite taste and a limited budget, a dichotomy she balanced with a talent for spying gems at flea markets and vintage stores. Most people looking at her thought she&#x2019;d maxed out the credit card on Madison Avenue, when she&#x2019;d put herself together for pennies. I never thought much about clothing, which led to playful repartee between us. I needled her for being a fashionista, contrasting myself as someone who couldn&#x2019;t care less about what he wore. I claimed to dress in the &#x201c;first available&#x201d; clothing I found in my closet. But she was too smart to accept my preposterous claim, countering nimbly that I had <i>selected</i> every piece of clothing in my closet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone thinks about what they wear,&#x201d; she said, laying me bare, &#x201c;even people like you who claim they don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>Walking jauntily out of customs at San Francisco International Airport in my new British Burma jacket, topped off with an Australian bush hat I also bought in the disposal store, was meant to be a playful concession to her irrefutable point.<br><br>A tan man in a khaki bush jacket and an olive green wide-brimmed hat pinned up on one side strode out of the glass doors of customs. I almost didn&#x2019;t recognize Mel. He&#x2019;d been gone two weeks, the longest we&#x2019;d been apart since we&#x2019;d met over two years earlier. I saw him anew. My heart quickened as I watched him, with his usual intensity, searching for my face in the waiting crowd&#x2014;and then our eyes met. He looked great. Our embrace knocked off his hat, an authentic Australian Army bush hat with the official puggaree band and medallion, he was quick to point out. But it was not his hat that most intrigued me. It was the jacket. How perfect the color, the raised lines of twill, the slightly worn collar and cuffs. This four-pocket jacket screamed &#x201c;authentic&#x201d; and &#x201c;adventure.&#x201d; He caught my stare.<br> <br>&#x201c;Like it?&#x201d; he said with a grin.<br><br>Driving home, Mel regaled me with stories of the Outback and the Great Barrier Reef, but my eyes kept drifting from his face to the jacket. Something was different. Had he acquired this new worldliness, this rather heroic nonchalance, from his adventures Down Under, or was it the jacket?<br> <br>I had been fascinated by the transformative power of clothing since my first job at sixteen in a department store in downtown San Francisco. Visually starved by a childhood of Catholic school uniforms, I ravenously studied the dressing habits of the clientele from the more sophisticated side of the city. It became clear to me that sartorial habits communicated as much as Professor Henry Higgins discerned from accents. I began to understand how clothes conveyed character, charisma, and class, and with a newly refined eye, I picked out treasures lost in the bins of secondhand stores and flea markets, making slight alterations when necessary, to stretch my small clothing budget. Mel&#x2019;s new jacket said with panache close to everything that I and the friends I admired valued in life: character, adventure, heritage, and independence, especially from the frivolous dictates of fashion. However, it could use some new buttons.<br> <br>Mel trusted me with the improvements. I added suede elbow patches and leather trim on the cuffs and collar, and swapped the metal military buttons for wooden ones. He loved the jacket even more and thanked me profusely.<br> <br>&#x201c;My favorite jacket of all time,&#x201d; he said, and he wore it almost every day.<br><br>With Patricia&#x2019;s classy refinements, the bush jacket became my proudest possession. Never had I been more at home in a piece of clothing. The jacket had an alchemical effect. I felt roguish and buoyant. Wearing it, I seemed to walk taller, with a more worldly gait. Everywhere I went, people stopped me with a comment or question.<br> <br>&#x201c;What a great jacket!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did you get that fabulous jacket?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me, do you mind if I ask you where you bought your jacket?&#x201d;<br> <br>On and on and on.<br> <br>The jacket had a message for me, and it didn&#x2019;t take me long to get it: here was the business we&#x2019;d been looking for. Patricia got the same message on her own. Yes!<br> <br>Between us, we had $1,500 in our bank accounts. We would use it to start a company that would sell jackets like the British Burma jacket and anything else like it we could find.<br> <br>Therein lay the full and complete business plan of a writer and an artist who had quit their jobs to make it on their own.<br> <br>&#x201c;What should we name it?&#x201d; Patricia wondered.<br> <br>That didn&#x2019;t take me a second.<br> <br>&#x201c;Banana Republic&#x201d; popped into my head the moment she asked. What better proverbial source of military surplus than politically unstable tropical countries? I fantasized that routine coups produced an abundance of disposed uniforms from toppled regimes.<br> <br>I could not have been happier. The name was not only catchy, but in 1978 it was jarringly irreverent as well. If years in journalism taught me anything, it was to grab &#x2019;em and get their attention. It was easier then. The era of fanciful company names spawned by dot-coms had yet to dawn.<br> <br>The name was the easy part.<br> <br>Starting a company wasn&#x2019;t so easy. Neither of us had any experience in business or had taken even a single business course in college. We knew nothing about retail, nothing about mail order, nothing about manufacturing, nothing about surplus, nothing about finance, nothing about management. The only asset we had was our own oblivion. That would keep us blissfully ignorant of the bewildering and arbitrary impediments that would entangle us until we became so embroiled that quitting was no longer a possibility.<br> <br>As any reporter would, I began making phone calls. I learned that when the U.S. government declared military goods surplus, everything went to auction. I tracked down the next nearby auction at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California. There the auctions were divided into &#x201c;lots&#x201d; into which government bureaucrats dumped all kinds of goods in no sensible order. A lot might contain &#x201c;27 typewriters, used; 1,500 tubes of U.S. Army toothpaste, new; 2 F4F Wildcat propellers, used; four Jeeps&#x2019; windshields, used; 724 pair of khaki shorts, size 42, used,&#x201d; and so on. If you wanted the shorts, you had to take the toothpaste too. For this reason, most of the bidders tended to be &#x201c;jobbers,&#x201d; who were essentially junk dealers. They pulled up the truck, loaded the pallets, and pawned off the pieces to whomever and wherever they could. A few more phone calls, and I learned the names of the top six jobbers in the United States. One of them was right over the bridge in Oakland.<br> <br>His name was Zimm, short for Zimmerman. I learned he had a huge warehouse overflowing with military surplus piled floor to ceiling.<br> <br>I sensed that if we walked in cold, Zimm would not know what to make of us. In spite of our company name, I doubted that we could pose as insurgents looking to outfit threadbare comrades. More seriously, we didn&#x2019;t own a surplus store or have any pedigree in the surplus world. We needed a plan. Patricia devised one: we would pose as rich dilettantes. She would wear an expensive-looking dress and her highest heels to convey the impression that she was a trust fund heiress looking for &#x201c;some interesting pieces&#x201d; to supplement a boutique she was about to open. I would be the indulgent husband.<br> <br>The visit became a strolling poker match, as the three-hundred-pound Zimm waddled behind us through the dimly lit, cavernous warehouse. It smelled like a mix of wet cement and rotting remainders of sandwiches. Occasionally he drew our attention to &#x201c;goods&#x201d; he was willing to part with at &#x201c;a good price, depending on the quantity.&#x201d; It seemed as though we were wandering in a dark sepia photograph among brown, tan, and gray-green cloth mountains rising up from the cold, damp concrete floor. We could feel Zimm straining to size us up in the long silences.<br> <br>So much stuff was packed into bins and piles that it was difficult to get a good look at what anything was. I asked him about British Burma jackets. He&#x2019;d seen them but didn&#x2019;t have any. Instead he pointed out piles of used combat boots, bales of new-issue nonwrinkle polyester shirts, woolen U.S. Army mittens, fatigue caps, plastic tarps, rope, mosquito netting. Each time, we nodded and moved on.<br> <br>Now and then Patricia would pick up an item, feel the fabric, examine a detail, ask the price. The first tw...</p><h2>Rubbernecker</h2><p><b> Breathtaking.

Here is an unprecedented investigation of an epoch of spectacular fraud and labyrinth subterfuge unique in western history. As a result of centuries of Neoplatonic-Hermetic intrigue, Rome became the repository and cultivator of alien forces which would only fully emerge in the twentieth century.<br><br>The Establishment would have us believe that the papacy of the past is synonymous with relentless inquisition of the occult, when in truth the occult took control of the papacy and from behind a wall of artifice and disguise, persecuted mainly those occultists who set themselves up as rivals to papal power, while shielding agents of the Neoplatonic-Hermetic and Kabbalistic conspiracy within the papal fold. This book names the guilty conspirators including many pontiffs, such as Popes Alexander VI, Leo X, Clement VII, Sixtus V and others. The author demonstrates that much of what we have been told about the history of the Church since the Renaissance has been an ingeniously mounted illusion.<br><br>The Occult Renaissance Church of Rome is a chronicle of magic, mind control and the betrayal of the Christian ecclesia on the part of an operation of deception of world-historical significance.<br><br>Table of Contents: More Catholic than the Pope; Neoplatonic Hermeticism; The Serpent in the Garden of the Quattrocento; The Priest and the Platonists; Pope Alexander and the Wizard; Bonfire of the Verities; The Sorcerer Abbott; The Reuchlin Revolution; Renaissance High Art: An Initiation; The Grand Egyptian Lodge of Vatican City; The Cabal s Co-conspirators; The Moral Theology of Mental Reservation and Equivocation in the Church of Rome; Ecclesiastical Sodomy and its Root; The Hermetic Prince of the Second Vatican Council; Neoplatonic-Hermetic Kabbalism in the Modern Era; The Breeders of Money Gain Dominion over the Church of Rome; A Prophecy Fulfilled; An Occult Miscellany; Neoplatonic Philosophy and Freemasonry.</p><p>Michael Hoffman is a leading scholar of the western secret societies and the history of ideology in early modern Europe and Britain.

Pilots who practice effective risk management have predetermined personal standards and have formed habit patterns and checklists to incorporate them. This handbook presents methods pilots can use to manage the workloads associated with each phase of flight, for a safer, more enjoyable and less stressful experience for both themselves and their passengers. In the last 20 years, approximately 85 percent of aviation accidents have been caused by &#x201c;pilot error&#x201d;; often the result of a tendency in flight training to focus solely on the physical aspects of flying the aircraft. The flight instructor who integrates risk management into flight training teaches aspiring pilots how to be more aware of potential risks in flying, clearly identify those risks, and manage them successfully. The FAA's <i>Risk Management Handbook</i> aids students and pilots in gaining a solid understanding of how to avoid the most common pilot errors. This full-color manual covers subjects such as human behavior, identifying and mitigating risk, aeronautical decision-making, single-pilot resource management, automation, and risk management training. Appendices contain checklists and scenarios to aid in setting personal minimums, sample risk management scenarios, and a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) "risk assessment" checklist.</p><p>The <strong>Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)</strong> is the government agency that oversees and regulates procedural standards for the aviation industry. <strong>Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, Inc.

But does it really feel full or are you stretched too thin? Enter Stew Friedman, Wharton professor, adviser to leaders across the globe, and passionate advocate of replacing the misguided metaphor of work/life balance&#x201d; with something more realistic and sustainable. If you&#x2019;re seeking balance&#x201d; you&#x2019;ll never achieve it, argues Friedman. The idea that work&#x201d; competes with life&#x201d; ignores the more nuanced reality of our humanity the interaction of four domains: work, home, community, and the private self. The goal is to create harmony among them instead of thinking only in terms of trade-offs. It can be done.<br><br>Building on his national bestseller, <i>Total Leadership</i>, and on decades of research, teaching, and practice as both consultant and senior executive, Friedman identifies the critical skills for integrating work and the rest of life. He illustrates them through compelling original stories of these remarkable people:<br><br> former Bain &amp; Company CEO and Bridgespan co-founder <b>Tom Tierney</b><br> Facebook COO and bestselling author <b>Sheryl Sandberg</b><br> nonprofit leader and US Navy SEAL <b>Eric Greitens</b><br> US First Lady <b>Michelle Obama</b><br> soccer champion-turned-broadcaster <b>Julie Foudy</b><br> renowned artist <b>Bruce Springsteen</b><br><br>Each of these admirable (though surely imperfect) people exemplifies a set of skills for being real, being whole, and being innovative that produce a sense of purpose, coherence, and optimism.<br><br>Based on interviews and research, their stories paint a vivid picture of how six very different leaders use these skills to act with authenticity, integrity, and creativity and they prove that significant public <i>success is accomplished not at the expense of the rest of life, but as the result of meaningful engagement in all its parts</i>. With dozens of practical exercises for strengthening these skills, curated from the latest research in organizational psychology and related fields, this book will inspire you, inform you, and instruct you on how to take realistic steps now toward leading the life you truly want.<br></p><p>Since 1984 <b>Stew Friedman</b> has been teaching at Wharton, where he is the Practice Professor of Management.

The impact briefly knocked her out, and when she started to get up, she immediately knew something was very wrong. Amy had suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and was about to start a journey unlike anything she had ever experienced. Her life had changed in literally a blink of the eye. This book is a collection of her short articles, most of which were originally published on The Huffington Post. Learn about what it means to have a TBI as you read about her struggles and frustrations, like the days she can&#x2019;t remember how to run the microwave, or how she gets lost driving to familiar places. Understand what it&#x2019;s like to suffer fatigue and exhaustion after doing a simple task that most take for granted. This book is perfect for TBI survivors, their caregivers, friends and loved ones. It is a great book for survivors to give to their supporters so that they, too, can understand what those with TBI are dealing with on a daily basis. &#x201c;Amy&#x2019;s book not only offers insight and details on brain injuries, but it also sheds light on an often-over looked and misunderstood issue. As a traumatic brain injury survivor, it gives me hope that one day the traumatic brain injury community will finally get the recognition and help it needs.&#x201d; ~ Ali Wallace, Miss Oregon 2015 &amp; TBI survivor</p><p>Amy sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in February of 2014 after falling on a patch of ice and landing full-force on the back of her skull. She is still recovering and understanding the full scope of her injury. She is an author, professional photographer, and creative coach located in Saint Paul, MN. She is a frequent contributor to the Huffington Post, and a loud and proud advocate for TBI awareness. She travels the country with her Yorkie, Pixxie, and brings awareness everywhere she goes! She believes that the healing process begins with the telling of your story, releasing everything that you&#x2019;ve been bottling up inside. Her goal is to tell other survivors stories, and share their images. TBI is an invisible disability that many don&#x2019;t understand. She wants to bring an awareness and understanding to the world, and hopes that people will have more compassion for those who look seemingly fine (but inside are struggling with memory or cognitive issues, such as herself). She is addicted to Starbucks, Miss Me jeans, and all things pink and glittery.<b><b></b></b><b>"Amy's book not only offers insight and details on brain injuries, but it also sheds light on an often-over looked and misunderstood issue.

The last passenger pigeon on earth, Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914. The deadliest maritime disaster in American history was the explosion of the steamboat Sultana, built in the Queen City. Just outside the city, a young Annie Oakley beat her future husband in a shooting contest. The nation&#39;s first train robbery occurred in the Cincinnati area, and some clever victims hid jewelry in their hair and bodices. From the Black Brigade&#39;s role in protecting the city against Confederate siege to the original 1937 Cincinnati Bengals, author Jeff Suess reveals the triumphs and tribulations of the first major American city founded after the American Revolution.</p><p>Jeff Suess is author of Lost Cincinnati (The History Press) and the librarian of the Cincinnati Enquirer, where he keeps the newspaper archive and writes about Cincinnati history. He regularly does presentations on local history and leads discussions on graphic novels at the Mercantile Library and the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. Jeff also writes fiction and has had stories published by Pocket Books, Post Mortem Press and DC Comics.</p><h2>The Cajuns: Americanization of a People</h2><p><p>The past sixty years have shaped and reshaped the group of French-speaking Louisiana people known as the Cajuns. During this period, they have become much like other Americans and yet have remained strikingly distinct. <i>The Cajuns: Americanization of a People</i> explores these six decades and analyzes the forces that had an impact on Louisiana's Acadiana.</p><p> In the 1940s, when America entered World War II, so too did the isolated Cajuns. Cajun soldiers fought alongside troops from Brooklyn and Berkeley and absorbed aspects of new cultures. In the 1950s as rock 'n' roll and television crackled across Louisiana airwaves, Cajun music makers responded with their own distinct versions. In the 1960s, empowerment and liberation movements turned the South upside down. During the 1980s, as things Cajun became an absorbing national fad, &#x201c;Cajun&#x201d; became a kind of brand identity used for selling everything from swamp tours to boxed rice dinners. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the advent of a new information age launched &#x201c;Cyber-Cajuns&#x201d; onto a worldwide web. All these forces have pushed and pulled at the fabric of Cajun life but have not destroyed it.</p><p> A Cajun himself, the author of this book has an intense personal fascination in his people.</p><p> By linking seemingly local events in the Cajuns' once isolated south Louisiana homeland to national and even global events, Bernard demonstrates that by the middle of the twentieth century the Cajuns for the first time in their ethnic story were engulfed in the currents of mainstream American life and yet continued to make outstandingly distinct contributions.</p></p><p><p>A history of how Cajun culture coped with forces that threatened its uniqueness</p><b>Shane K.

In contrast, <i>The</i> Not <i>So Wild, Wild West</i> casts America's frontier history in a new framework that emphasizes the creation of institutions, both formal and informal, that facilitated cooperation rather than conflict. Rather than describing the frontier as a place where heroes met villains, this book argues that everyday people helped carve out legal institutions that tamed the West.</p> <p>The authors emphasize that ownership of resources evolves as those resources become more valuable or as establishing property rights becomes less costly. Rules evolving at the local level will be more effective because local people have a greater stake in the outcome. This theory is brought to life in the colorful history of Indians, fur trappers, buffalo hunters, cattle drovers, homesteaders, and miners. The book concludes with a chapter that takes lessons from the American frontier and applies them to our modern "frontiers"&#x2015;the environment, developing countries, and space exploration.</p></p><p>"Hollywood will never be able to top this portrayal of the history of the West in the U.S. The history that Anderson and Hill depict is the current situation of the majority of entrepreneurs in developing and former Soviet countries.

Chapter authors are highly engaged scholars and leaders in the field whose voices ring with wisdom and experience. I especially appreciate the way the book moves from the big-picture 'whys' of PD to the fine-grained 'whats' and 'hows' of sustaining ongoing school improvement. The complexities of PD are explored, such as the tensions that may surface when policy decisions and evidence-based practices are at odds.

The Eleventh Edition&nbsp;of Walter Oleszek&#x2019;s definitive work updated with new developments and fresh research, continues to examine how this procedural context governs every aspect of the House and Senate and affects lawmakers as they make voting decisions, expedite legislation, or defeat a bill. Congressional Procedures and the Policy Process reveals how the majority and minority parties use procedural devices to achieve their political goals and offers an assessment of the role of conference committees in reconciling bicameral differences. Not shying away from the complexity of the topic, Oleszek and new coauthors Mark Oleszek, Elizabeth Rybicki, and Bill Heniff Jr. ensure that the machinations of Congress are understandable through an array of interesting examples, topical cases, and anecdotes that they are uniquely positioned to witness and experience firsthand.<br> <br> ?</p><p><p><strong>Walter J. Oleszek</strong> is a senior specialist in the legislative process at the Congressional Research Service.

The main strength of the text is the framing of the work around the policy making process. Our Political Science program has a strong Public Administration tone, so this text explains how the nuts and bolts of policy are created and how the legislative branch truly affects the outcome. We are trying to prepare our students to work in government, so any textbook that explains the nitty-gritty of policy-making is a must teach."</p> -- Joshua R. Meddaugh<br><br>"The book does an outstanding job in covering all the necessary details on congressional rules and procedures, most of which are not easy to understand. Oleszek and et. al. successfully explains very technical concepts in a clear and accessible fashion. In addition, a lot of examples and anecdotes certainly help. It has been and will remain to be a must-read for all the congressional politics students and Washington insiders." -- Hong Min Park<br><br>"This book offers impressively comprehensive coverage of just about every aspect of congressional procedures that I can think of.

It is also the study of the relationship among these parts. The heart, for example, consists of chambers, valves, and associated blood vessels.<b></b></p><p><b>Physiology </b>- Physiology is the study of the function of body parts. The parts of the heart, for example, work together to pump the blood throughout the body.</p><p>There is a close association between anatomy and physiology. Structure complements function. The four chambers of the heart have muscular walls that contract to pump the blood. The makeup of the valves prevents the backflow of blood.</p><p><b>1.2 Levels of Organization</b></p><p>The anatomy of the human body is composed of different levels of organization. These levels represent a series of steps. Each level is a building step for the next level. These levels are:<b></b></p><p><b>Atom </b>- All matter consists of elements. These simple substances exist as discrete, submicroscopic particles called atoms. The four most common elements of the human body are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.<b></b></p><p><b>Molecule </b>- Atoms bond into molecules. About 65 percent of human body weight consists of water molecules. Smaller molecules bond into larger molecules that have biological functions. Monosaccharides (e.g., glucose), for example, bond into polysaccharides (e.g., starch). These carbohydrates are an energy source.<b></b></p><p><b>Organelle </b>- Molecules compose the parts of the cell called organelles. Each of these parts carries out a specific function. The ribosome, for example, is the site of protein synthesis.<b></b></p><p><b>Cell </b>- The cell is the smallest unit displaying the properties of life. Cells tend to specialize. There are about 200 different kinds of specialized cells in the human body. Neurons (nerve cells) send signals. Leukocytes (white blood cells) fight infection.<b></b></p><p><b>Tissue </b>- Similar cells function together in a tissue. Muscle cells work together in skeletal muscle tissue. These cells contract, producing body movement.<b></b></p><p><b>Organ </b>- Two or more tissues work together in an organ. The heart is an organ that consists of several tissue types.<b></b></p><p><b>Organ Systems </b>- Organs with related functions are part of the same organ system. The heart and blood vessels are organs of the circulatory system. They function to circulate the blood throughout the body.<b></b></p><p><b>Organism </b>- All organ systems make up the organism. The organ systems of the human body include the nervous, circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems.</p><p><b>1.3 Anatomical Terms</b></p><p>Anatomical terms are used to describe the makeup of the body accurately and concisely. All of these terms are used with reference to anatomical position. In this position the subject studied is facing forward and standing erect. The arms are hanging at the sides. The palms and toes are pointed forward.</p><p><b>1.3.1 Directional Terms</b></p><p>Directional terms compare the relative position of one body part to another body part. These terms occur in pairs. The members of each pair have opposite meanings.<b></b></p><p><b>Superior/Inferior </b>- Superior means closer to the head. Inferior means closer to the feet. The neck is superior when compared to the chest, which is inferior. When compared to the abdomen, the chest is superior and the abdomen is inferior.<b></b></p><p><b>Anterior/Posterior </b>- Anterior (ventral) refers to a part that is closer to the front of the body. Posterior (dorsal) refers to a part that is closer to the back. The heart is anterior when compared to the vertebral column, which is posterior. When compared to the sternum (breastbone), the heart is posterior and the sternum is anterior.<b></b></p><p><b>Medial/Lateral </b>- Medial refers to a part that is closer to an imaginary midline passing vertically through the body. Lateral refers to a part that is farther from this midline. The nose is medial when compared to the eyes (lateral). When compared to the ears, the eyes are medial. The ears are lateral.<b></b></p><p><b>Proximal/Distal </b>- Proximal refers to a part of a limb that is closer to the trunk (torso) of the body. Distal refers to a limb part that is farther from the trunk. The forearm is proximal when compared to the wrist (distal). The wrist is proximal when compared to the fingers (distal).</p><p>Other directional terms include:<b></b></p><p><b>Superficial </b>- Closer to the surface of the body<b></b></p><p><b>Deep </b>- Farther away from the surface of the body<b></b></p><p><b>Parietal </b>- Referring to the wall of a body cavity<b></b></p><p><b>Visceral </b>- Referring to an organ within the body cavity</p><p><b>1.3.2 Planes and Sections of the Body</b></p><p>Imaginary incisions can be made through the body to study the internal anatomy. These sections represent imaginary planes.<b></b></p><p><b>Sagittal Plane </b>- A sagittal plane passes through the body longitudinally, dividing it into left and right regions. A midsagittal section passes through the midline of the body.<b></b></p><p><b>Coronal (Frontal) Plane </b>- A coronal plane passes through the body longitudinally, dividing it into anterior and posterior regions.<b></b></p><p><b>Transverse Plane </b>- A transverse plane passes through the body horizontally, dividing it into superior and inferior regions. These sections can also pertain to organs of the body. Sagittal, coronal, and transverse planes all pass through the heart.</p><p><b>1.3.3 Body Cavities</b></p><p>There are two main cavities of the human body, the dorsal cavity and ventral cavity. Each cavity is divided into subcavities.<b></b></p><p><b>Dorsal Cavity </b>- The dorsal cavity consists of the <b>cranial cavity </b>and <b>spinal cavity</b>. The cranial cavity is formed by the superior bones of the skull. It contains the brain. The spinal cavity is formed by a series of vertebrae. It contains the spinal cord.<b></b></p><p><b>Ventral Cavity </b>- The ventral cavity consists of <b>thoracic </b>and <b>abdominopelvic subcavities</b>.</p><p>The thoracic cavity is superior to the diaphragm. It is subdivided into a left and right <b>pleural cavity</b>. The pleural cavities contain the lungs. The <b>mediastinum </b>is the space between the pleural cavities. It contains the trachea (windpipe), esophagus, thymus gland, and heart. The heart is contained within a separate cavity of the mediastinum, the <b>pericardial cavity</b>.</p><p>The abdominopelvic cavity is inferior to the diaphragm. The larger abdominal portion contains the liver, gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, and most of the large intestine. The smaller pelvic portion contains the rest of the large intestine, bladder, and reproductive organs.</p></p><h2>Karl Marx&#39;s Theory of History</h2><p><p>First published in 1978, this book rapidly established itself as a classic of modern Marxism. Cohen's masterful application of advanced philosophical techniques in an uncompromising defense of historical materialism commanded widespread admiration. In the ensuing twenty years, the book has served as a flagship of a powerful intellectual movement--analytical Marxism. In this expanded edition, Cohen offers his own account of the history, and the further promise, of analytical Marxism. He also expresses reservations about traditional historical materialism, in the light of which he reconstructs the theory, and he studies the implications for historical materialism of the demise of the Soviet Union.</p></p><p><p>"An admirable and formidable book."--<b>E.

In Chakra Mantras, he brings previously hidden knowledge from India and Tibet and teaches us through the use of mantras how to activate our secret chakras, which contain the keys to our spiritual progress. Located along the spine, the chakras process energy for all of our waking activities, and during sleep they provide energy for healing and cleansing the physical body. But there is another, higher octave of functioning that these chakras can achieve, if they are given higher states of spiritual energy in which to operate. This higher octave provides paths for spiritual development that ultimately lead to spiritual liberation or freedom from karma. A powerful method for charging the chakras with higher energy is through the use of Sanskrit mantras. With energy-invoking tools, stories from India&#39;s ancient tales, and amusing anecdotes, Chakra Mantras provides the information needed for fueling spiritual advancement through the use of healing sounds and chakra mantras.</p><p>Thomas Ashley-Farrand is one of the West&#39;s foremost authorities of Vedic and Buddist Sanskrit mantras. He has been recognized for his flawless mastery of mantra practice and has gathered more than 8.000 transliterated mantras- the most comprehensive body of these sacred-sound syllables in the English language.

Yet masses of tourists make it virtually impossible to imagine the splendor of the palace as it existed from the time of Louis XIV, the Sun King, in the 17th century, until the fall of Napoleon III in 1870. Now, four talented photographers were granted unlimited access to Versailles when the chï¿½teau was closed to visitors, and their work allows privileged access not only to the private suites of Louis XV, the boudoirs of Marie-Antoinette and Madame de Pompadour, the celebrated Hall of Mirrors, the Royal Chapel, the charming Orangerie, and Marie Antoinette&#x2019;s bucolic Hamlet, but also to mysterious chambers and hushed apartments never normally seen.

White House counsel Ron Fairbanks is ordered to investigate. There are persistent rumors that the Secretary was an accomplished womanizer with ties to a glamorous call girl. There is also troubling evidence of unofficial connections with international wheeler-dealers.</p><p>In death as in life, Blaine is a power to be reckoned with. For Fairbanks, who loves the President's daughter, one point is soon clear: only a few highly placed insiders had access to the Lincoln Bedroom that fateful evening. And one of them was the President. . . .</p></p><p><p>Margaret Truman has won faithful readers with her works of biography and fiction, particularly her ongoing series of Capital Crimes mysteries. Her novels usher us into the corridors of power and privilege, poverty and pageantry, in the nation's capital. She lives in Manhattan.</p>Andrews Air Force Base, Tuesday, June 12, 9:00 PM<br><br>The radio on the helicopter was tuned to the tower frequency, and the crisp metallic voices said Air Force One was on final approach long before anyone could see it. The little welcoming party--the Vice President, the President's daughter, the President's Special Counsel--climbed down from the helicopter and crossed the ramp under umbrellas held by the Marine attendants. They passed through the knot of media people waiting in the drizzle and stood apart from them, a little closer to the roll of red carpet that would be unrolled to the foot of the steps when Air Force One was on the ground. They joined the media group in staring expectantly at the overcast sky.<br><br>Lynne Webster, the President's daughter, found Ron Fairbanks's hand. She squeezed it. One of the television people noticed and nudged the woman beside him. It was nothing odd. Washington knew there was something between the President's daughter and his Special Counsel. The NBC camera zoomed for a moment to the clasped hands, and suddenly hundreds of thousands of people saw. For many it was more interesting than the President's return from Paris, where he had just signed some kind of trade agreement. His daughter was a tall, handsome, brown-haired girl. The nation had watched her mature in three years in the White House: from a gawky adolescent to a young woman gaining self-assurance, poise, and presence. Fairbanks was an obscure figure. Everyone had seen his picture in Time or somewhere: one of the bright young men who worked for the President; but what he did, exactly, was not clear. Anyway, he was a good-looking young fellow; he made a good picture standing in the rain holding the hand of the President's daughter. They made an appealing couple, a good picture for the home screens and for tomorrow's tabloids.<br><br>Air Force One appeared beneath the overcast--a Boeing 747 now--huge, majestic, vaguely eerie in its landing configuration, with flaps down, gear down, long thin beams of light extending from its wings toward the runway. It settled slowly, its movement almost imperceptible, silent, powerful. The honor guard came to attention just as the tires touched the runway with a quick screech, and the airplane rushed past, noisy now, roaring, slowing. It passed the ramp and ran almost to the end of the runway; then slowly it turned and began its slow taxi back to the ramp.<br><br>Wind drove the rain momentarily into the faces of the little welcoming party. Fairbanks put a finger to Lynne's cheek and pushed away a strand of her hair that had been blown there and stuck in the glistening rain water. It was an intimate gesture the television cameras missed. He smiled at her, she returned it. They were not lovers, whatever the speculation. Since last fall, when she left for her third year of college, he had seen her only two or three times. Now that she was back at the White House for the summer, he would see her more often. He might become, over the summer, something more than a convenient, quasi-official escort for her--the staff bachelor who was available to accompany her when it was awkward for her to be alone. They might decide if they wanted their relationship to be anything more . . . they were amused, both by the situation and by the speculation it generated. They understood each other. She liked him, he liked her.<br><br>The 747 taxied to the ramp, its great engines whining, overpowering the chatter among the media people and the low monotone of the network narrators. Air Force One never failed to awe. Even the bold legend along its body--united states of america--was awesome by its simplicity. President Webster understood the dramatic value of the big airplane, and he took full advantage of it. He had retired the 707 that had long served as Air Force One and substituted this 747 for it--not without some grumbling from the Congress--probably as much from a sense of its grandeur as from the practical need. The pilots swung its nose around, and the airplane came to a stop only a foot from the stairway that was now nudged up to it.<br><br>The airplane sat there in the white glare of floodlights--raindrops sparkling in the unnaturally bright electric light. The engines stopped. Marines rolled out the red carpet to the foot of the stairs. The door opened. The Marine Band struck up "Ruffles and Flourishes." The President appeared in the door. "Hail to the Chief." He smiled and turned to speak to his wife. She stepped out. They stood for a moment, blinking into the glare of the light, both smiling, nodding blindly at the small crowd at the foot of the stairs. Two Secret Service men trotted up the stairs with umbrellas. The President grinned and motioned them away. With his wife's hand in his, he hurried down the stairs.<br><br>Robert Lang Webster, President of the United States. He was fifty-five years old and looked maybe a few years younger. They said he had thrived on the presidency; and, although his face was deeply lined, he was gray only at the temples and his hair was thick and dark; he was hard and thin and given to abrupt, decisive movement. He allowed another Secret Service man to drape a raincoat over his shoulders as he stepped up to the microphones and faced the television cameras.<br><br>Catherine Steele Webster. She was fifty-four and looked forty. She acknowledged that a New York surgeon had taken some tucks in the flesh around her face and subdued some wrinkles, and she said she would have it done again whenever she thought she needed it. She accepted a raincoat as she sidestepped the microphones and reached out to take Lynne's hands. She stood for a moment, facing Lynne and smiling, then nodded at Ron Fairbanks and winked before she moved to her husband's side. She nudged her husband and muttered something that the CBS microphone, a little closer to her than the others, picked up for the nation--"Let's get on with it, it's raining."<br><br>The President beckoned Lynne to come and stand beside him. He kissed her on the cheek.<br><br>The Vice President, Allan Torner, began to say something about the President's quest for peace and prosperity and about how the nation had watched what he had done in Paris and now welcomed him home. The President listened to Torner and nodded at him as he spoke, but he was unable--and not at much effort--to conceal his impatience.<br><br>"Thank you, Mr. Vice President--Allan," said the President as soon as Torner paused and might be finished. "I appreciate your coming out to meet us. I appreciate the ladies and gentlemen of the print and electronic media also coming here. This is not a very dramatic homecoming. We made a quick trip to Paris to initial the preliminary trade agreements entered into among many nations in the interest of mutual aid and shared prosperity. It really was not necessary for me to go, as some have pointed out, except that I wanted to demonstrate to the people of the United States and the people of the participating nations of Europe, Asia, and North America--all of whom will be called on to make certain sacrifices to achieve our joint goals--that the President of the United States is wholly committed to the economic program represented by the multilateral agreements. That is why I went. The negotiations are continuing. The initial accomplishment of this agreement will be followed by other accomplishments, other elements of the program. We have charted a difficult course. But we will achieve our goals."<br><br>He wiped rainwater from his forehead with the back of his hand, and he could be seen to chuckle quietly as he flipped the water in the direction of the TV cameras. It was somehow the right gesture for the moment, one of the small gestures for which he seemed to have an unconscious but almost infallible instinct. Some of the media people laughed.<br><br>The President stepped back from the microphones and glanced at the Secret Service man nearest him: a suggestion the party was ready to be led to the helicopter.<br><br>"Mr. President!" The CBS man, Ted O'Malley, was trying to ask a question. "May we ask why the Secretary of State did not go to Paris with you? Is there anything to the rumor he is resigning?"<br><br>The President pointed, grinning, at O'Malley. "Hi, Ted!" he yelled. He was away from the microphones, and they were not picking him up. "Don't believe all the rumors you hear," he called over his shoulder as he turned away from the media group and herded his party toward the helicopter. He waved and grinned again at O'Malley before he turned his back and moved decisively away.<br><br>The President and Catherine Webster, Lynne, the Vice President, and Ron Fairbanks climbed into the helicopter. The floodlights had been swung away from Air Force One and now glared on the green and white helicopter. The rotor was turning slowly above the helicopter. The red lights on it were blinking. The President's face appeared for a moment in a window. He waved at the media people and the small crowd behind the fence. The rotor swung fast, and the helicopter rose.<br><br>The 'copter hovered above the ramp, heavily, gracelessly, and tipped forward slightly and slid over the ground, away from the ramp and the lights, into the darkness. Two others, just like it, rose and joined it before it gained altitude and left the area of the Air Force base. The other two were helicopter gunships, carrying electronics to detect any threat to the presidential helicopter--from a missile, from an airplane, from a shot fired from the ground--and to take electronic countermeasures, or to fire shots if necessary. The three helicopters flew in formation. The presidential helicopter flew on the left of the formation tonight. Sometimes it flew in the middle, sometimes on the right; an attacker would not know which helicopter carried the President.<br><br>Ron Fairbanks disliked the helicopter. No matter it was the President's helicopter, it was always noisy, always shook, and its erratic motion unsettled his stomach. He could never be less than fully conscious that it was the presidential helicopter and that he, Ron Fairbanks of Fairfield, California, was aboard with the President of the United States; but it unsettled his stomach just the same. The President was saying something, but it was not directed at him, and he did not try to listen.<br><br>The President was talking to Lynne. Fairbanks had noticed before how, at times like this when no one else could claim his attention, the President would focus his attention on Lynne and for a few minutes give himself exclusively to her. It did not happen by chance; he made a point of it. She was his youngest child, and he had been absent during years that were important to her--absent running for the Senate, then being a senator, absent running for President, then being President. At moments like this--and they were always private moments--he would lean toward her and speak quietly but with intensity and animation. And warmth. If the public had seen the genuine, human warmth he showed in these private moments, his public image might have been radically different.<br><br>The public image was of an able, tough, decisive man. He inspired confidence. The editorialists and pundits said of him that he was the first President in decades from whom the American people were willing to accept leadership, because he inspired confidence. He was combative. (He had utterly declared war on the Congress--privately he had once referred to the Senate as a "collection of minor-league dipsomaniacs and fugitives from dementia praecox." Publicly, he had called the United Nations General Assembly a circus. He had called a sign-waving, chanting crowd of anti-nuclear power demonstrators "a mob of infants having a public tantrum.") He was almost ruthless at times. When his first Secretary of the Treasury admitted on "Meet the Press" that an income tax rate adjustment the Administration was sponsoring might have an inflationary effect, the President summarily fired him. ("In this Administration everyone sings from the same sheet," he had said.) He was blunt. (He told a summit conference of European heads of government that "the basic foreign policy of the United States is pursuit of the enlightened self-interest of the United States.") The American people loved all of it. He had a high approval rating in the polls.<br><br>But he was not shallow. (The remainder of his statement to the European heads of government was that the enlightened self-interest of the United States dictated adherence to the program of multilateral trade agreements he had doggedly promoted for three years, and he had been telling them that their own self-interest would be best served if they, too, adhered to that program.) He had courage. (He had anticipated the political furor that would follow his firing of the Secretary of the Treasury and had decided to tough it out.) He could be subtle. (His statement about the anti-nuclear demonstrators was a signal to a hundred other groups of all kinds, who had made a fad of street tantrums, that demonstrations would not influence him to take positions he didn't believe in.) And he was a consummate political manipulator. (Even the Senate he had so colorfully characterized passed most of the legislation he wanted, because he had a thumb, and a dossier, on forty or fifty senators.)<br><br>He was powerful. He carried people along with him. His own sense of purpose was real. He was able to communicate much of that sense to the people who worked for him and some of it to the nation. He communicated more of his self-confidence.<br><br>He had almost walked away from his appointment with President-elect Webster without seeing him. He had flown from Washington for a two-o'clock appointment with Senator and President-elect Webster in his transition headquarters in the Renaissance Center in Detroit; and when five o'clock came and he knew he would miss his return flight if he waited any longer, he almost walked out and caught a cab back to the airport. He might be only a young lawyer working his way up in a Washington firm, but he had his self-respect, and the apparent rudeness of Webster or of his organization turned him angry. Anyway, the dramatic impact of walking out on an appointment with the President-elect of the United States somehow appealed to him; and it was only the thought of the explanations he would have to make back in Washington that kept him in the bleak temporary reception room, pacing, staring down from fifty floors at the gray waters of the Detroit River through heavy snow swirling on a gusty winter wind. . . .</p><h2>Intergenerational Christian Formation: Bringing the Whole Church Together in Ministry, Community and Worship</h2><p>"One generation commends your works to another; they tell of your mighty acts." &#x2015;Psalm 145:4 Most churches and faith communities segment their ministries by age and generation. The kids go to children&#x2019;s church, the teens go to youth group. Worship services are geared toward different generational preferences, and small groups gather people at the same life stage, whether singles, young marrieds, parents, or empty nesters. In some congregations, people may never interact with those of other ages. But it was not always so. Throughout biblical tradition and the majority of history, communities of faith included people of all ages together in corporate worship, education, and ministry. The church was not just multigenerational; it was intergenerational, with the whole church together as one family and people of all ages learning from one another in common life. In this comprehensive text, Holly Allen and Christine Lawton offer a complete framework for intentional intergenerational Christian formation. They provide the theoretical foundations for intergenerationality, showing how learning and spiritual formation are better accomplished through intergenerational contexts. It is not just elders teaching youth; learning also takes place when adults discover fresh insights from children. Then the authors give concrete guidance for intergenerational praxis on how worship, learning, community, and service can all be achieved intergenerationally. Case studies of intergenerational congregations provide models for how a culture of intergenerationality can be created in local churches. This volume serves as an essential guide for all preparing for and involved in congregational ministry and formation. Discover the riches of intergenerational ministry, and let all generations commend the works of God to one another.</p><p>Holly Catterton Allen (PhD, Talbot School of Theology) is professor of family science and Christian ministries at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee, where she holds a joint appointment in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the College of Bible and Ministry.

(Tim Pyles, The Christian Chronicle, March 2013)<br><br>"This book is for pastors, lay leaders and professional church educators and students who want to model congregational life on the kingdom of God instead of marketing strategies designed to appeal to generational narcissism based on individual preference. This is one book that will both encourage and equip congregations to be less 'conformed to the world,' less prone to say, 'I have no need for you.' This is a book that argues persuasively from solid research, as well as the biblical mandate, for congregations to really 'love one another.' This book is honest about the costly demands of intentional intergenerational development as well as its rich rewards." (Robbie F. Castleman, author, Parenting in the Pew)<br><br>"Drawing on classical developmental theories and biblical interpretation, Allen and Ross offer evangelicals a useful guide to the benefits and practices of intergenerational ministry. Their examples of multiage small groups and the true stories of multigenerational interactions included throughout the text are particularly helpful." (Karen Marie Yust, Union Presbyterian Seminary)<br><br>"In <em>Intergenerational Christian Formation</em> Holly Allen and Christine Ross give us thorough, powerful and practical approaches to growing Christ-followers of all generations. Pastors, church leaders and all believers can greatly benefit from their wise insights into how Christians grow and mature when the different generations learn that we are better together. I highly recommend this book." (Peter Menconi, author of The Intergenerational Church: Understanding Congregations from WWII to www.com)<br><br>"Thought-provoking--and refreshing! Allen and Ross present a perfect blend of the biblical principles, academic inquiries and practical solutions surrounding one of the most significant, yet uncharted, areas in today's church communities. A must-read for all who desire to pass along a lasting Christian faith from generation to generation." (Jessica Stollings Strang, generational speaker and founder of re:Generations)<br><br>"Families are complex; family ministry even more so. Allen and Ross explain how the best of intentions brought about the separation of generations in the church with serious unintended consequences. Now the question is: How do we bring the generations back together again into the one body that is the church? In <em>Intergenerational Christian Formation</em> this question is scrutinized from every possible angle, with input from every possible source. Allen and Ross conclude by offering more than enough activities to get the generations mixing again. Pastors, directors of Christian education and lay ministers will be pulling this book off their shelves for advice and inspiration over and over again." (Dr. John W. Oberdeck, professor of theology and director for lay ministry, Concordia University Wisconsin)<br><br>"Christine Ross and Holly Allen genuinely believe in the intergenerational nature of the church, the people of God at every age together. They lay out an excellent vision for rebuilding that intergenerational nature in contemporary congregational life. Segmentation of a church's membership and age segregation have almost no place in their vision. They lay out the scriptural basis for the multigenerational church and review an amazing amount of literature in a concise and cogent way, and their writing is engaging and reader-friendly. Being a big fan of generational history, I really liked their presentation of it and how it works in the church. Read this book and intergenerational ministry seems so obvious. There is an outstanding review of literature reviewing learning and social theory, solid theory and theology, relevant observations and practical application--laying out how intergenerational ministry could happen in a congregational setting. They stress storytelling and tell some great stories in the process. One wonders how so much of the church sold out to an age-segregated approach when intergenerational church is so right. "What does this intergenerational church look like? I like the way they cite the Pauline 'one another' passages. Who wouldn't want to be a part of that kind of community?" (Terry Dittmer, director of youth ministry, the Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod)<br><br>"The authors have done a superb job making the case for the importance of intergenerational ministry in our churches. And the practical suggestions make it doable for every church. This book belongs on every pastor's bookshelf." (Ivy Beckwith, Ph.D., author of Postmodern Children's Ministry)<br><br>"Holly Allen and Christine Ross make a strong case for the importance of intergenerational ministry. They then follow this up with stories, examples and specific ideas for how to make intergenerational ministry happen in churches large or small. This book is a valuable resource for anyone in ministry." (Robert J.

The iconic Los Angeles newsprint booklet served a computerless demographic&#x2014;a quickly disappearing group, but one rife with stories. Who was the person selling the LARGE LEATHER JACKET, $10 OR BEST OFFER? It seemed important to find out, or, at least it was a great distraction from the screenplay.<br><br>Working with photographer Brigitte Sire, July interviewed thirteen <i>PennySaver</i> sellers to create portraits of their surprisingly moving, profoundly specific realities.

Well, recently I received a letter that had originally been sent from a reader to Faye Kellerman, who sent it on to us. The reader wrote about how much she loves Faye's books, and she was shocked to find a few typos in one of the books.

Hutchinson notes that there are numerous books which have dissected and re-dissected every possible aspect of classical music&#x2014;the composers, performers, their compositions, the musical structure, the history, and even the gossip and minutiae about the composers and performers. Yet, there are almost no books that focus on the significant part that black composers and performers played in influencing and in turn being influenced by classical music &#x201c;The list of Africans, African-Americans and Afro-European composers, conductors, instrumental performers, and singers,&#x201d; says Hutchinson, &#x201c;is and always has been, rich, varied, and deep. Sadly, the recognition of this has almost always come in relation to the work of a major European or white American composer.&#x201d; Hutchinson&#x2019;s aim in It&#x2019;s Our Music Too The Black Experience in Classical Music is not to update a book on blacks and classical music, or list the many notable individual breakthroughs of top flight black classical music performers and composers through the years. Instead he tells the story of how blacks have actually influenced the development, history and structure of classical music in its major varied forms; opera, chamber pieces, symphonies, and concertos. It&#x2019;s a story that&#x2019;s filled with tragedy and triumph, heart break and heroism. Hutchinson gives an exciting and entertaining glimpse into Mozart&#x2019;s &#x201c;borrowing&#x201d; a musical idea from the black violin virtuoso Chevalier Saint-Georges in the eighteenth century, Dvorak&#x2019;s basing a major part of his New World Symphony on Negro Spirituals in the nineteenth century, and composers such as Gershwin, Copeland. Stravinsky and Ravel, wildly embracing jazz and blues in some of their popular and acclaimed works in the twentieth century. It&#x2019;s Our Music Too The Black Experience in Classical Music is a fast paced, reader friendly, easy to understand look at just exactly what and how the greats in classical music have borrowed from and paid homage to jazz, blues, ragtime, boogie woogie and Negro spirituals. &#x201c;Throughout I name and recommend many pieces to listen to by the greats of classical music,&#x201d; notes Hutchinson, &#x201c;who were directly inspired by black musical forms as well as the works of black composers who have written exceptional works that have influenced the works of other classical composers.&#x201d; Hutchinson also tells how black performers such as Roland Hayes with his unique interpretations of German leider, and Marian Anderson and Jessye Norman with their distinctive tones and vibrant, fresh renderings of, and subsequent path breaking performances in the major works of opera giants, Giuseppi Verdi and Richard Wagner have greatly altered how these master&#x2019;s works are heard today. It&#x2019;s Our Music Too The Black Experience in Classical Music, takes the reader on an exciting, eye opening, and revealing journey through the world of classical music in which the major critics, composers and performers tell in their words their appreciation of the major contribution blacks made to classical music. &#x201c;It is no exaggeration or overstatement to say that classical music does owe a debt to the black experience in classical music,&#x201d; says Hutchinson, &#x201c;And the goal is to show music lovers and readers how that debt continues to be paid in concert halls everywhere.&#x201d;</p><p>About Earl Ofari Hutchinson Noted Political analyst Earl Ofari Hutchinson also has an M.A. in Humanities from California State University, Dominguez Hills and a specialty in the advanced study of music, focusing on concepts of meaning and form in music.

The delegates have agreed to assemble on August second to sign a single copy that would show they stand unanimous in their desire to separate from British rule. But the struggle to bring all the congressmen to Philadelphia for the formal signing seems as insurmountable as the fight for independence against the world's greatest army...</em></p><p>With cries of war spreading across the colonies and pressure mounting to join the Revolution, an intrepid young Post Rider, Nathaniel Marten, is reluctant to raise a rifle for the Cause. His heart is pulled by sympathy for his mother, English-born and loyal to her homeland; concern for his father, whose artisanal gun shop is being converted into an armory for the newly formed Continental army; and fear for the peaceful Shawnee tribe he has long considered his second family.</p><p>In a chance encounter with Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, Nathaniel is asked to take on the role of a lifetime: secure the remaining signatures by carrying the sole copy of the Declaration to the congressmen unable to attend the formal signing. The risks? British generals and double-crossing spies are eager to capture both Nathaniel and the document so they can divide the thirteen colonies already weakened by war.</p><p>Through encounters with well-known original founding fathers and mothers, and by witnessing the effects of the Revolution on ordinary Americans, Nathaniel must learn that independence--for himself, for those he loves, and for the countryï¿½ï¿½--is not granted, it's chosen.

The mother of three boys, she lives in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>His eyes are the wrong color.<br><br>That was the panicky thought that tore screaming through Charlie&#x2019;s mind.<br><br>They should have been sky blue. They weren&#x2019;t: they were a hazelish shade of brown.<br><br>She stared up at him, unblinking, and felt the ground tilt beneath her feet.<br><br>It has to be him. Who else could it be?<br><br>His eyes were the wrong color, he had a tiny white scar beside his mouth that had never been there before, his hair was cut short and was kind of styled, and his six-ï¿½foot-ï¿½three-ï¿½inch frame looked leaner than it should have been. Maybe that was because the black leather motorcycle jacket he was wearing with jeans and a button-ï¿½up collared blue shirt (!) hid some of the truly impressive muscles that the T-ï¿½shirt she was used to seeing him in had revealed.<br><br>Yeah. And maybe not.<br><br>Michael? Her heart shivered at the question, which she didn&#x2019;t repeat out loud.<br><br>Dr. Elisabeth Kï¿½bler-ï¿½Ross had posited that there were five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. A little more than two weeks after Michael had disappeared&#x2014;ï¿½seventeen days, to be precise&#x2014;ï¿½Charlie reckoned that she&#x2019;d just been torpedoed right into the third stage, because what kept running through her head was a feverish Please God I&#x2019;ll do anything please.<br><br>She stood in the small, grassy graveyard, with the crude white cross that marked Michael&#x2019;s grave in front of her and the viburnum hedge from which she had once gathered an armful of flowers to mark it to her left. As the steepled old First Baptist Church loomed in the background, Charlie desperately clung to a sliver of hope.<br><br>Please let it be him.<br><br>The heavy silver man&#x2019;s watch that hung loosely around her left wrist&#x2014;ï¿½Michael&#x2019;s watch, several sizes too large for her arm&#x2014;ï¿½glinted in the golden autumn sun. She didn&#x2019;t know if that was a good sign or a bad one.<br><br>Vacillating between joy and fear, she looked at the man frowning down at her with an intensity born of marrow-ï¿½deep need. Except for those few small differences, it was all there: the square jaw, the broad cheekbones and forehead, the straight nose and beautifully cut mouth. The tawny hair, the height, the outrageous good looks. Her hand was on his arm: she could feel the solid muscles through the smooth leather of his jacket. Yet her eyes probed his and she came up empty. There was no electric zing, no trumpets signaling a joyous reunion going off in her head. The vibration she was picking up with every atom of sensitivity she possessed translated to This is a stranger. Reality hit, and the fragile little bit of hope she&#x2019;d been cherishing shattered like glass.<br><br>Face it, she told herself savagely as her hand dropped away from his arm, this gorgeous man is not Michael. He might be turning her inside out simply by standing there, but that was because of what was going on with her rather than anything to do with him.<br><br>The multicolored pinwheels of happiness, of answered prayers, of unlikely miracles that had begun twirling through her bloodstream from the moment she had set eyes on this man faded and stilled. It&#x2019;s not Michael, she told herself again, and the world once more became the gray, colorless place that his absence from her life had made it.<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; she asked, her voice raspy. Her throat was so tight it hurt to talk.<br><br>&#x201c;Rick Hughes.&#x201d; The way his eyes narrowed on her face with speculation, the way the tan skin around them tightened and crinkled, made her stomach twist. The expression was all Michael, even if the brisk syllables with their total lack of a slow Southern drawl were not. &#x201c;And you are?&#x201d;<br><br>Okay, he apparently didn&#x2019;t know her. Didn&#x2019;t recognize her.<br><br>Pain curled through her system.<br><br>She introduced herself, still in that same strangled voice: &#x201c;Charlie Stone.&#x201d; Still in shock from encountering the living image of the dead man she had only lately been able to admit even to herself that she loved, standing beside the grave where his body was interred. Despite everything her senses were telling her, she continued to search the man&#x2019;s face, his eyes, for some hint of Michael, some sign that it was him after all. She forced herself to stop, to get a grip.<br><br>Michael&#x2019;s gone. She knew that, but she was obviously having trouble coming to terms with it.<br><br>Rick Hughes&#x2019;s surprised expression was so much like Michael&#x2019;s that it was the equivalent of an arrow that lodged directly in her heart.<br><br>&#x201c;Charlie Stone? Dr. Charlotte Stone?&#x201d; His gaze moved over her. Watching his face, she was able to follow along: she had chestnut brown hair, a little longer than shoulder length, that today was pulled back into a low ponytail. Delicate features, fair complexion, denim blue eyes. Five-ï¿½six and slender. Actually, more slender than usual, because since Michael had disappeared she&#x2019;d barely been eating. Once Michael had told her men expected someone with her credentials to be butt-ï¿½ugly instead of the babe he&#x2019;d labeled her. Remembering this, she interpreted Hughes&#x2019;s expression accurately, or at least she was pretty sure it was accurately. Her spine stiffened in response to the sheer sexism of men who automatically assumed that an educated woman would be unattractive.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she replied. And yes, okay, there was possibly a frosty overtone to her answer.<br><br>&#x201c;I was just up at Wallens Ridge,&#x201d; he said, referring to the supermax prison where Charlie, a psychiatrist, was currently conducting research on a government grant, studying the psychology of serial killers. It was also the place where, a little more than eight weeks ago now, Michael had been murdered. &#x201c;And I was told that you&#x2019;re the person I need to see. I was also told that you wouldn&#x2019;t be available for several more days, as you&#x2019;d taken a temporary leave of absence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I did.&#x201d; To assist an FBI team in catching a serial killer. Less than an hour before on this late Thursday afternoon in early October, she&#x2019;d arrived back at Lonesome Pine Airport with plans to take the weekend to get her head on straight before returning to work at the prison on Monday. She&#x2019;d been five minutes away from her house in Big Stone Gap when, from the backseat of the taxi that was currently waiting by the curb, she had spotted his stunningly familiar figure in the graveyard. Only, of course, in the way things tended to work in her life, it turned out that he was the wrong man.<br><br>The tiny part of her brain that wasn&#x2019;t still reeling from shock scoffed: You didn&#x2019;t really think that he was Michael standing there, alive, did you?<br><br>But from the crushing sense of loss she was experiencing, it seemed that somewhere deep in her heart, or soul, she had.<br><br>You can&#x2019;t be gone. Not just like that. She sent the thought winging directly toward Michael, one of dozens that had taken that route since he&#x2019;d disappeared, and immediately shut that folly down. Even if, somewhere in the misty reaches of the universe, he by some miracle did still exist (and she knew she shouldn&#x2019;t even begin to allow herself to hope for that), mental telepathy had never been part of their thing. And yes, sometimes bad things happened, just like that.<br><br>Bad things like Michael being destroyed.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Charlie tried to focus. When it came to her professional life she tried to keep things, well, professional. Her hands were clenched into tight fists at her sides, she discovered. She wasn&#x2019;t yet able to tear her eyes away from this man&#x2019;s handsome face, but she made herself unclench her fingers.<br><br>&#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d; she asked, liking to think that her voice sounded less off-ï¿½putting than it had before.<br><br>&#x201c;I have a court order granting me access to some files that are apparently in your possession.&#x201d; He cocked a thumb at the grave, which, because it was still fairly new, formed a little higher mound and sported a little less grass than the ones around it. M. A. Garland had been hand-ï¿½painted on the marker in black, slightly uneven letters, along with the dates of Michael&#x2019;s birth and death. Looking at it made her chest ache. &#x201c;On this guy: Michael Garland.&#x201d;<br><br>Once again the ground seemed to tilt beneath Charlie&#x2019;s feet. Hearing Michael&#x2019;s name spoken out loud was bad enough, but at his graveside by his doppelgï¿½nger?<br><br>Really, God? What fresh hell is this?<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; she asked again, in a different intonation. If he wasn&#x2019;t Michael&#x2014;ï¿½and he wasn&#x2019;t, she was now almost convinced of that&#x2014;ï¿½then the fact that this man existed, that he was apparently alive and real and human and right at this moment standing close enough to touch, officially blew her mind.<br><br>Her subconscious was shouting a warning: Hello, something&#x2019;s up. Big red flag here.<br><br>All kinds of crazy possibilities started popping into her mind, running the gamut from his being some kind of shape-ï¿½shifting demon to a faux-ï¿½Michael from an alternate dimension to a very real-ï¿½seeming hallucination brought on by grief and stress. At least, these possibilities might seem crazy to anyone who didn&#x2019;t live in her world. Short version was, she had the unfortunate ability to see the newly, violently dead; Michael had been one of the serial killers she was studying; had gotten himself murdered; and then, as one of those newly violently dead that only she could see, had come back as a ghost to haunt, taunt, and otherwise make her life miserable until she&#x2019;d made the truly colossal mistake of falling in love with him, at which point he&#x2019;d been yanked away into a purple-ï¿½twilight version of purgatory, where, according to all the psychic sources she&#x2019;d desperately consulted when he had disappeared, he&#x2019;d almost certainly suffered a fate far worse than death or even hell: oblivion.<br><br>In other words, the possibility of a shape-ï¿½shifting demon or alternate dimension or too-ï¿½real hallucination wasn&#x2019;t as outlandish as it might sound.<br><br>To put it succinctly, in her world shit happened.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a lawyer,&#x201d; Hughes said, adding to her complete and utter shock. That this spitting image of Michael, whose contempt for every component of the justice system was oceans deep, was a lawyer floored her. &#x201c;A criminal defense lawyer,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The client I&#x2019;m here on behalf of was charged with murdering his girlfriend. In the course of investigating the circumstances surrounding the crime, we discovered that it was identical in every significant detail to those committed by a serial killer known as the Southern Slasher&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½he jerked a thumb at the grave again&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201c;also known as Michael Garland. I thought we had a winner of an alternative theory about the identity of the true killer in my client&#x2019;s case until I learned that Mr. Garland was in prison at the time this particular murder was committed. Still, I&#x2019;m hoping that by following up on Mr. Garland I might learn something that&#x2019;ll shed some light on my client&#x2019;s case.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since you&#x2019;re here, you obviously know he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; She couldn&#x2019;t say Michael&#x2019;s name aloud: it just wouldn&#x2019;t come out. For her to not see Michael&#x2019;s grave was also impossible. It was there, in her field of vision, no matter how much she fought to not look at it. But looking at the man in front of her was even worse: it hurt. In the past two-ï¿½plus weeks, she&#x2019;d discovered that psychic pain could be every bit as agonizing as pain inflicted by a gun or a knife. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not going to be shedding light on anything. You could have just sent for the files.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d also like to talk to you,&#x201d; Hughes said. From his voice, she was pretty sure he&#x2019;d grown up somewhere north of the Mason-ï¿½Dixon Line. The vibe he gave off was more big-ï¿½city polished than anything Mi&#x2014;ï¿½no, she wasn&#x2019;t going there. You have to stop thinking about him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping you can help me with some questions I have.&#x201d;<br><br>The last thing in the world she wanted to do was talk to him about anything, much less about Michael. Encountering him like this had shaken her badly; she had barely been keeping it together as it was. Now this&#x2014;ï¿½this terrible cosmic joke the universe was apparently playing on her was making her head spin, making it hard for her to catch her breath, making it impossible for her to think clearly. Looking at the man in front of her was physically painful. And it was starting to feel scary. If he wasn&#x2019;t Michael&#x2014;<br><br>He&#x2019;s not. You know he&#x2019;s not.<br><br>At the moment she wasn&#x2019;t capable of much critical thinking beyond that, but she had managed to form and hold on to one crucial thought: Until you get this figured out, you need to be careful.<br><br>There was so much wrong with what was happening here she couldn&#x2019;t even begin to count the ways.</p><h2>A Course of Their Own: A History of African American Golfers</h2><p>Bill Spiller was forty-seven when he was forced by desperate finances to caddie at the Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles. One day Spiller was caddying for a member who became outraged by Spiller&#x2019;s stories of inequities and suffering during his golfing career. The golfer urged Spiller to write California&#x2019;s attorney general, who later ordered the Professional Golfers&#x2019; Association (PGA) to cease its discrimination. In 1961 the &#x201c;Caucasian race&#x201d; clause was deleted from the PGA constitution. This was an historic decision that gave black golfers the chance to compete at the highest level in the sport.&nbsp;Golf has long been the domain of white men. During the twentieth century, however, African American pioneers such as Lee Elder, Howard Wheeler, and Charlie Sifford broke down the barriers for black golfers who wanted to play, and win, as equals with white golfers. <i>A Course of Their Own</i> looks at golf from the perspectives of these men, who had courage as well as remarkable skills.

Some say it&#x2019;s the genes we inherit at conception. Others are sure it&#x2019;s the environment we experience in childhood. But could it be that many of our individual characteristics&#x2014;our health, our intelligence, our temperaments&#x2014;are influenced by the conditions we encountered before birth?<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the claim of an exciting and provocative field known as fetal origins. Over the past twenty years, scientists have been developing a radically new understanding of our very earliest experiences and how they exert lasting effects on us from infancy well into adulthood. Their research offers a bold new view of pregnancy as a crucial staging ground for our health, ability, and well-being throughout life.<br> <br>Author and journalist Annie Murphy Paul ventures into the laboratories of fetal researchers, interviews experts from around the world, and delves into the rich history of ideas about how we&#x2019;re shaped before birth. She discovers dramatic stories: how individuals gestated during the Nazi siege of Holland in World War II are still feeling its consequences decades later; how pregnant women who experienced the 9/11 attacks passed their trauma on to their offspring in the womb; how a lab accident led to the discovery of a common household chemical that can harm the developing fetus; how the study of a century-old flu pandemic reveals the high personal and societal costs of poor prenatal experience.<br> <br><i>Origins </i>also brings to light astonishing scientific findings: how a single exposure to an environmental toxin may produce damage that is passed on to multiple generations; how conditions as varied as diabetes, heart disease, and mental illness may get their start in utero; why the womb is medicine&#x2019;s latest target for the promotion of lifelong health, from preventing cancer to reducing obesity. The fetus is not an inert being, but an active and dynamic creature, responding and adapting as it readies itself for life in the particular world it will enter. The pregnant woman is not merely a source of potential harm to her fetus, as she is so often reminded, but a source of influence on her future child that is far more powerful and positive than we ever knew. And pregnancy is not a nine-month wait for the big event of birth, but a momentous period unto itself, a cradle of individual strength and wellness and a crucible of public health and social equality.<br> <br>With the intimacy of a personal memoir and the sweep of a scientific revolution, <i>Origins </i>presents a stunning new vision of our beginnings that will change the way you think about yourself, your children, and human nature itself.</p><p><b>Annie Murphy Paul</b> is a magazine journalist and book author who writes about the biological and social sciences. Born in Philadelphia, she graduated from Yale University and from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. A former senior editor at <i>Psychology Today</i> magazine, she was awarded the Rosalynn Carter Fellowship for Mental Health Journalism. Her writing has appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Discover</i>, <i>Health</i>, <i>O: The Oprah Magazine</i>, and many other publications. She is the author of <i>Origins: How the Nine Months Before Birth Shape the Rest of Our </i>Lives and <i>The Cult of Personality: How Personality Tests Are Leading Us to Miseducate Our Children, Mismanage Our Companies, and Misunderstand Ourselves</i>.Science writer Paul (The Cult of Personality) segues between pondering her own second pregnancy and the developing literature on fetal origins in this fascinating study of the prenatal period, what one scientist calls the staging ground for well-being and disease in later life. Drawing upon current research and interviews with experts in this burgeoning field, Paul explores such varied topics as diet and nutrition, stress, environmental toxins, exercise, and alcohol use. She cites some frightening if by now familiar discoveries, such as the existence of 200 industrial chemicals that can be found in babies' umbilical cords, as well as some unusual findings, such as the discovery that women who consumed a daily dose of chocolate during their pregnancies gave birth to babies who smiled more at six months. She also exposes links between low birth weight and later cardiovascular disease, and muses upon the possibility that a dietary supplement might one day protect future children from cancer. As the author delves deeply into the vulnerabilities of the prenatal environment, she comes away with a compelling sense of the importance of how society cares for and supports pregnant women. Focusing on how to minimize harm and maximize benefit during the nine months before birth, Paul's thought-provoking text reveals that this pivotal period may be even more significant and far-reaching than ever imagined. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Former park ranger William C. Tweed takes readers on a tour of the Big Trees in a narrative that travels deep into the Sierras, around the West, and all the way to New Zealand; and in doing so he explores the American public's evolving relationship with sequoias. It comes as no surprise that the groves in Yosemite and Calaveras were early tourist destinations, as this species that predated Christ and loomed over all the world's other trees was the embodiment of California's superlative, almost unbelievable appeal. When sequoias were threatened by logging interests, the feelings of horror that this desecration evoked in people catalyzed protection efforts; in a very direct way, this species inspired the Park Idea. And sequoias' influence doesn't end there: as science evolved to consider landscapes more holistically, sequoias were once again at the heart of this attitudinal shift. Featuring an entrancing cast of adventurers, researchers, politicians, and environmentalists,&nbsp;<i>King Sequoia</i>&nbsp;reveals how one tree species has transformed Americans' connection to the natural world.</p><p>William C. Tweed brings humans closer to nature using the knowledge and skills he developed during thirty years as a chief naturalist, historian, and writer with the National Park Service. His published works include <i>Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks: The Story Behind the Scenery</i> (KC Publications, 1980); <i>Challenge of the Big Trees: A Resource History of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks</i> (coauthored with Larry Dilsaver, Sequoia Naturalist History Association, 1990); <i>Death Valley and the Northern Mojave: A Visitor's Guide</i> (coauthored with Lauren Davis, Cachuma Press, 2003); and <i>Uncertain Path: A Search for the Future of National Parks</i> (University of California Press, 2010).

As Tweed insightfully reminds us, the solemn majesty and beauty of the giant sequoia inspired the conservation movement that has changed the world.

Over the course of a week in 1987, he murdered 14 members of his own family, a former co-worker, and a stranger. <br><br>In 1979, Simmons retired as an Air Force Master Sergeant following 20 years of service. The instability that followed his military days exacerbated his desire for control over his family. Simmons used intimidation, humiliation, and violence to assert dominance over all but one of his family members. He allowed a softer side to surface for his favourite daughter, Shelia, whom he forced into an incestuous relationship and eventually fathered her child. <br><br>His need for total control led to isolation within his family and an inability to hold down a job. His frustration grew to untold levels when Sheila left the family home and married another man. With his plans in ruin and his grip softening, Simmons surprisingly supported his family's desire for a big Christmas celebration. The stage was set for a heartwarming reunion but he had laid a very different set of plans.<br><br><i>Obeying Evil</i> portrays the 'Mockingbird Hill Massacre' from the perspective of Ronald Gene Simmons.

Author Paul Foxman believes there are three interacting ingredients that contribute to anxiety in children -- biological sensitivity, personality, and stress overload.<br><br>The Worried Child shows that anxiety is preventable &#x2013; or can at least be minimized &#x2013; by raising children's self confidence, increasing social and self-control skills, and teaching them how to play, relax, and communicate their feelings and needs. Written for parents and teachers and anyone dealing with children, the guide covers the importance of adequate rest, sleep, and exercise and provides detailed lists, skill exercises, sample dialogues, and case studies. It also presents extensive information on the various types and symptoms of anxiety disorders. Advice for educators, health care professionals, childcare workers and psychotherapists is included along with a chapter and tutorial written specifically for children.<br><br>The Worried Child is a highly accessible self-help guide for anyone dealing with a child who is or may become anxious.</p><p>Paul Foxman, Ph.D. is a psychologist and Director of the Center for Anxiety Disorders in Vermont. He is the author of Dancing with Fear and the coauthor of Conquering Panic and Anxiety Disorders. Dr. Foxman wants children to feel safe and grow up without fear or anxiety. To help keep the magic in childhood, he co-founded the Lake Champlain Waldorf School in Shelburne, Vermont.Psychologist Foxman (Dancing with Fear) has penned a caring yet straightforward book about helping kids deal with feelings of angst. Noting that one in five children suffers from a mental health problem, Foxman says some experts call today's children the "shell-shocked" generation. Divorce, crime, violence, failing schools, the threat of terrorism and drug abuse are a few of the contemporary issues often magnified for kids by vivid media coverage, and they've contributed to the rise of stress and anxiety among children, says Foxman. The author, who suffered from anxiety as a child and as an adult, melds personal and professional experience as he differentiates between normal and abnormal worrying (the latter involves a degree and frequency that interferes with daily routines). According to Foxman, three factors coincide to create an anxious child: biological sensitivity, personality and stress. Children who are perfectionists, who are overly sensitive to criticism and have difficulty with assertiveness, among other traits, are prone to anxiety, though many of the worried child's personality traits, such as intelligence and a strong sense of responsibility, are positive.

Two times, then nothing. No one else heard, only me. Even when I was a baby in my cradle. My mother didn&#x2019;t hear. My father didn&#x2019;t hear. My sisters continued sleeping. But the cat looked up.<br><br>When I was old enough I opened the door. There she was. A lady wearing a gray coat. She had a branch from a hawthorn tree, the one that grew outside my window. She spoke, but I didn&#x2019;t know her language. A big wind had come up and the door slammed shut. When I opened it again, she was gone.<br><br>But I knew what she wanted.<br><br>Me.<br><br>The one word I&#x2019;d understood was daughter.<br><br>I asked my mother to tell me about the day I was born. She couldn&#x2019;t remember. I asked my father. He had no idea. My sisters were too young to know where I&#x2019;d come from. When the gray lady next came, I asked the same question. I could tell from the look on her face. She knew the answer. She went down to the marsh, where the tall reeds grew, where the river began. I ran to keep up. She slipped into the water, all gray and murky. She waited for me to follow. I didn&#x2019;t think twice. I took off my boots. The water was cold. I went under fast.<br><br>It was April in New York City and from the window of their room at the Plaza Hotel everything looked bright and green. The Story sisters were sharing a room on the evening of their grandparents&#x2019; fiftieth anniversary party. Their mother trusted them completely. They were not the sort of teenagers who would steal from the minibar only to wind up drunk in the hallway, sprawled out on the carpet or nodding off in a doorway, embarrassing themselves and their families. They would never hang out the window to wave away cigarette smoke or toss water balloons onto unsuspecting pedestrians below. They were diligent, beautiful girls, well behaved, thoughtful. Most people were charmed to discover that the girls had a private, shared language. It was lovely to hear, musical. When they spoke to each other, they sounded like birds.<br><br>The eldest girl was Elisabeth, called Elv, now fifteen. Meg was only a year younger, and Claire had just turned twelve. Each had long dark hair and pale eyes, a startling combination. Elv was a disciplined dancer, the most beautiful in many people&#x2019;s opinions, the one who had invented the Story sisters&#x2019; secret world. Meg was a great reader and was never without a book; while walking to school she often had one open in her hands, so engrossed she would sometimes trip while navigating familiar streets. Claire was diligent, kindhearted, never one to shirk chores. Her bed was made before her sisters opened their sleepy eyes. She raked the lawn and watered the garden and always went to sleep on time. All were self-reliant and practical, honor students any parents would be proud to claim as their own. But when the girls&#x2019; mother came upon them chattering away in that language no one else could understand, when she spied maps and graphs that meant nothing to her, that defined another world, her daughters made her think of clouds, something far away and inaccessible.<br><br>Annie and the girls&#x2019; father had divorced four years earlier, the summer of the gypsy moths when all of the trees in their yard were bare, the leaves chewed by caterpillars. You could hear crunching in the night. You could see silvery cocoon webbing in porch rafters and strung across stop signs. People said there were bound to be hard times ahead for the Storys. Alan was a high school principal, his schedule too full for many visits. He&#x2019;d been the one who&#x2019;d wanted out of the marriage, and after the split he&#x2019;d all but disappeared. At the age of forty-seven, he&#x2019;d become a ladies&#x2019; man, or maybe it was simply that there weren&#x2019;t many men around at that stage of the game. Suddenly he was in demand. There was another woman in the background during the breakup. She&#x2019;d quickly been replaced by a second girlfriend the Story sisters had yet to meet. But so far there had been no great disasters despite the divorce and all of the possible minefields that accompanied adolescence. Annie and her daughters still lived in the same house in North Point Harbor, where a big hawthorn tree grew outside the girls&#x2019; bedroom window. People said it had been there before Long Island was settled and that it was the oldest tree for miles around. In the summertime much of the Storys&#x2019; yard was taken up with a large garden filled with rows of tomato plants. There was a stone birdbath at the center and a latticework trellis that was heavy with climbing sweet peas and tremulous, prickly cucumber vines. The Story sisters could have had small separate bedrooms on the first floor, but they chose to share the attic. They preferred one another&#x2019;s company to rooms of their own. When Annie heard them behind the closed door, whispering conspiratorially to each other in that secret vocabulary of theirs, she felt left out in some deep, hurtful way. Her oldest girl sat up in the hawthorn tree late at night; she said she was looking at stars, but she was there even on cloudy nights, her black hair even blacker against the sky. Annie was certain that people who said daughters were easy had never had girls of their own.<br><br>Today the Story sisters were all in blue. Teal and azure and sapphire. They liked to wear similar clothes and confuse people as to who was who. Usually they wore jeans and T-shirts, but this was a special occasion. They adored their grandmother Natalia, whom they called Ama, a name Elv had bestowed upon her as a toddler. Their ama was Russian and elegant and wonderful. She&#x2019;d fallen in love with their grandfather in France. Although the Rosens lived on Eighty- ninth Street, they kept their apartment where Natalia had lived as a young woman in the Marais district of Paris, near the Place du Marchï¿½- Sainte-Catherine, and as far as the Story sisters were concerned, it was the most wonderful spot in the world.<br><br>Annie and the girls visited once a year. They were infatuated with Paris. They had dreams of long days filled with creamy light and meals that lasted long into the hazy blur of evening. They loved French ice cream and the glasses of blue-white milk. They studied beautiful women and tried to imitate the way they walked, the way they tied their scarves so prettily. They always traveled to France for spring vacation. The chestnut tree in the courtyard was in bloom then, with its scented white flowers.<br><br>The Plaza was probably the second-best place in the world. Annie went to the girls&#x2019; room to find her daughters clustered around the window, gazing at the horse-drawn carriages down below. From a certain point of view the sisters looked like women, tall and beautiful and poised, but they were still children in many ways, the younger girls especially. Meg said that when she got married she wanted to ride in one of those carriages. She would wear a white dress and carry a hundred roses. The girls&#x2019; secret world was called Arnelle. Arnish for rose was minta. It was the single word Annie understood. Alana me sora minta, Meg was saying. Roses wherever you looked.<br><br>&#x201c;How can you think about that now?&#x201d; Elv gestured out the window. She was easily outraged and hated mistreatment of any sort. &#x201c;Those carriage horses are malnourished,&#x201d; she informed her sister.<br><br>Elv had always been an animal fanatic. Years ago she&#x2019;d found a rabbit, mortally wounded by a lawn mower&#x2019;s blades, left to bleed to death in the velvety grass of the Weinsteins&#x2019; lawn. She&#x2019;d tried her best to nurse it to health, but in the end the rabbit had died in a shoebox, covered up with a doll&#x2019;s blanket. Afterward she and Meg and Claire had held a funeral, burying the shoebox beneath the back porch, but Elv had been inconsolable. If we don&#x2019;t take care of the creatures who have no voice, she&#x2019;d whispered to her sisters, then who will? She tried to do exactly that. She left out seeds for the mourning doves, opened cans of tuna fish for stray cats, set out packets of sugar for the garden moths. She had begged for a dog, but her mother had neither the time nor the patience for a pet. Annie wasn&#x2019;t about to disrupt their home life. She had no desire to add another personality to the mix, not even that of a terrier or a spaniel.<br><br>Elv was wearing the darkest of the dresses, a deep sapphire, the one her sisters coveted. They wanted to be everything she was and traipsed after her faithfully. The younger girls were rapt as she ranted on about the carriage horses. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re made to ride around without food or water all day long. They&#x2019;re worked until they&#x2019;re nothing but skin and bones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Skin and bones&#x201d; was a favorite phrase of Elv&#x2019;s. It got to the brutal point. The secret universe she had created was a faery realm where women had wings and it was possible to read thoughts. Arnelle was everything the human world was not. Speech was unnecessary, treachery out of the question. It was a world where no one could take you by surprise or tell you a mouthful of lies. You could see someone&#x2019;s heart through his chest and know if he was a goblin, a mortal, or a true hero. You could divine a word&#x2019;s essence by a halo of color&#x2014;red was false, white was true, yellow was the foulest of lies. There were no ropes to tie you, no iron bars, no stale bread, no one to shut and lock the door.<br><br>Elv had begun to whisper Arnelle stories to her sisters during the bad summer when she was eleven. It was hot that August; the grass had turned brown. In other years summer had been Elv&#x2019;s favorite season&#x2014;no school, long days, the bay only a bicycle ride away from their house on Nightingale Lane. But that summer all she&#x2019;d wanted was to lock herself away with her sisters. They hid in their mother&#x2019;s garden, beneath the trailing pea vines. The tomato plants were veiled by a glinting canopy of bottle-green leaves. The younger girls were eight and ten. They didn&#x2019;t know there were demons on earth, and Elv didn&#x2019;t have the heart to tell them. She brushed the leaves out of her sisters&#x2019; hair. She would never let anyone hurt them. The worst had already happened, and she was still alive. She couldn&#x2019;t even say the words<br><br>for what had happened, not even to Claire, who&#x2019;d been with her that day, who&#x2019;d managed to get away because Elv had implored her to run.<br><br>When she first started to tell her sisters stories, she asked for them to close their eyes and pretend they were in the otherworld. It was easy, she said. Just let go of this world. They&#x2019;d been stolen by mortals, she whispered, given a false family. They&#x2019;d been stripped of their magic by the charms humans used against faeries: bread, metal, rope. The younger girls didn&#x2019;t complain when their clothes became dusted with dark earth as they lay in the garden, although Meg, always so tidy, stood in the shower afterward and soaped herself clean. In the real world, Elv confided, there were pins, spindles, beasts, fur, claws. It was a fairy tale in reverse. The good and the kind lived in the otherworld, down twisted lanes, in the woods where trout lilies grew. True evil could be found walking down Nightingale Lane. That&#x2019;s where it happened.<br><br>They were coming home from the bay. Meg had been sick so she&#x2019;d stayed home. It was just the two of them. When the man in the car told Claire to get in the backseat, she did. She recognized him from school. He was one of the teachers. She was wearing her bathing suit. It was about to rain and she thought he was doing them a favor. But he started driving away before her sister got into the car. Elv ran alongside and banged on the car door, yelling for him to let her sister out. He stopped long enough to grab her and drag her inside, too. He stepped on the gas, still holding on to Elv. &#x201c;Reunina lee,&#x201d; Elv said. It was the first time she spoke Arnish. The words came to her as if by magic. By magic, Claire understood. I came to rescue you.<br><br>At the next stop sign, Claire opened the door and ran.<br><br>Arnelle was so deep under the ground you had to descend more than a thousand steps. There were three sisters there, Elv had told Claire. They were beautiful and loyal, with pale eyes and long, black hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Like us,&#x201d; Claire always said, delighted.<br><br>If they concentrated, if they closed their eyes, they could always find their way back to the otherworld. It was beneath the tall hawthorn tree in the yard, beneath the chestnut tree in Paris. Two doorways no one else could get past. No one could hurt you there or tear you into pieces. No one could put a curse on you or lock you away. Once you went down the underground stairs and went through the gate there were roses even when snow fell in the real world, when the drifts were three feet deep.<br><br>Most people were seized by the urgency of Elv&#x2019;s stories, and her sisters were no exception. At school, classmates gathered round her at lunchtime. She never spoke about Arnelle to anyone but her dear sisters, but that didn&#x2019;t mean she didn&#x2019;t have stories to tell. For her school friends she had tales of life on earth, stories of demons she didn&#x2019;t want her sisters to hear. A demon usually said three words to put a curse on you. He cut you three times with a knife. Elv could see what the rest of them never could. She had &#x201c;the sight,&#x201d; she said. She predicted futures for girls in her history and math classes. She scared the hell out of some of them and told others exactly what they wanted to hear. Even in Paris when she went to visit her grandparents, the city was filled with demons. They prowled the streets and watched you as you slept. They came in through the window like black insects drawn to the light. They put a hand over your mouth, kept your head under water if you screamed. They came to get you if you ever dared tell and turned you to ash with one touch.<br><br>Each day, the number of girls who gathered around Elv in the cafeteria increased. They circled around to hear her intoxicating tales, told with utter conviction. Demons wore black coats and thick- soled boots. The worst sort of goblin was the kind that could eat you alive. Just a kiss, miss. Just a bite.</p><h2>Men Explain Things to Me: And Other Essays</h2><p>Rebecca Solnit&#39;s essay &#39;Men Explain Things to Me&#39; has become a touchstone of the feminist movement, inspired the term &#39;mansplaining&#39;, and established Solnit as one of the leading feminist thinkers of our time - one who has inspired everyone from radical activists to Beyonce Knowles. Collected here in print for the first time is the essay itself, along with the best of Solnit&#39;s feminist writings. From rape culture to mansplaining, from French sex scandals to marriage and the nuclear family, from Virginia Woolf to colonialism, these essays are a fierce and incisive exploration of the issues that a patriarchal culture will not necessarily acknowledge as &#39;issues&#39; at all. With grace and energy, and in the most exquisite and inviting of prose, Rebecca Solnit proves herself a vital leading figure of the feminist movement and a radical, humane thinker.</p><p>Writer, historian, and activist Rebecca Solnit is the author of sixteen books about civil society, popular power, uprisings, art, environment, place, pleasure, politics, hope, and memory. She is a Harper&#x2019;s contributing editor."This slim book seven essays, punctuated by enigmatic, haunting paintings by Ana Teresa Fernandez hums with power and wit." <i>Boston Globe</i><br><br>"The Antidote to Mansplaining." <i>The Stranger</i><br><br>"Feminist, frequently funny, unflinchingly honest and often scathing in its conclusions." <i>Salon</i><br><br>"Solnit tackles big themes of gender and power in these accessible essays. Honest and full of wit, this is an integral read that furthers the conversation on feminism and contemporary society." <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> Top Shelf<br><br>"Solnit [is] the perfect writer to tackle the subject: Her prose style is so clear and cool." <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>"The terrain has always felt familiar, but Men Explain Things To Me is a tool that we all need in order to find something that was almost lost." <i>National Post</i><br><br>"Where opponents would argue that feminism is humorless and superfluous, Men Explain Things to Me is a compelling argument for the movement's necessary presence in contemporary society. It approaches the subject with candor and openness, furthering the conversation and opening a new Pandora's box that's apt to change the way we talk about women's rights." <i>Shelf Awareness</i><br><br>"Solnit&#x2019;s intimate understanding of how the twin bulwarks of language and silence fuel political agendas is only part of what makes her writing so exciting. The other essays in the collection complement the first (some are even stronger), but theirs is the poetic correlation of masterful storytelling. Ultimately Solnit&#x2019;s interdisciplinary, patchwork narratives are drawn together by a single theme: hope." <i>The Baffler</i><br><br>"An engaging primer on the realities of mansplaining." <i>Bitch Magazine</i><br><br>"Solnit&#x2019;s pull-no-punches observations... make this a valuable contribution to feminist theory." <i>The Indypendent</i><br><br>"A riveting collection of feminist essays." <i>Chicagoist</i><br><br>"A necessary read in these fraught times. Starting with the title essay, which went viral and inspired the ever-useful term '<i>mansplaining</i>,' Solnit writes powerfully about the ways in which power is wielded in today&#x2019;s society, and brings awareness to the staggering inequalities that we wrestle with on a daily basis." <i>FlavorWire</i><br><br>"A brilliant, varied, and thoroughly enjoyable read and definitely an addition to my list of feminist faves." <i>Lip Magazine</i><br><br>"Sharp-witted and bold... quintessential Solnit." <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Sharp narratives that illuminate and challenge the status quo of women's roles in the world.

Weeks later, she still remembered the terrified expression on one waiter&#x2019;s face when she caught him by the arm before he carried his tray of cruditï¿½s into the party space.<br> <br>Despite her glacial blond beauty, the younger man practically flinched away from her touch as she adjusted his tie. Margot would admit that she&#x2019;d been a bit . . . demanding in organizing this event. She had taken every precaution to make sure that this evening&#x2019;s black-tie opening was as smooth as Rosaline Hewitt&#x2019;s recently Botoxed brow. She&#x2019;d commissioned a silk-leaf embroidered canopy stretching from the valet station to the entrance to prevent the guests&#x2019; hairstyles and gowns from being ruined by the summer rain. She&#x2019;d researched each invitee meticulously to find out who was gluten-free or vegan and adjusted the menu accordingly. She&#x2019;d arranged for two dozen species of exotic South American parrots to be humanely displayed among orchids and pitcher plants and a flock of flamingos to wade through the manufactured waterfall&#x2019;s rocky lagoon.<br> <br>She was not about to have all of that preparation undone by a cater waiter who didn&#x2019;t know how to keep a bow tie on straight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go,&#x201d; Margot said, nodding toward the warm, humid air of the false tropical jungle. He moved silently away from her, into the opulently lit space.<br> <br>Margot turned and tried to survey the greenhouse as it would appear to the guests, the earliest of which were already filtering into the garden, oohing and aahing. Calling it a greenhouse seemed like an understatement. The glass-paneled dome reached four stories into the sky, allowing the tropical plant specimens inside plenty of space to stretch. Carefully plotted stone paths wound through the flower beds, giving the visitor the impression of wandering through paradise. But knowing how much Chicago&#x2019;s riche-est of the riche enjoyed a nice soiree, the conservators had been smart enough to add a nice open space in the middle of the greenhouse to allow for a dance floor. She&#x2019;d arranged elbow-high tables around the perimeter, covered in jewel-tone silk cloths. Gold LED lights cast a hazy sunset glow over the room, occasionally projecting animated fireflies against the foliage. And since society&#x2019;s ladies would never do something so inelegant as visit a buffet, the waiters had been informed to constantly circulate with their trays of canapï¿½s in a nonobvious, serpentine pattern around the enormous shrimp tower in the middle of&#x2014;<br> <br>Wait.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Margot murmured, shaking her head. &#x201c;No, no, no.&#x201d;<br> <br>She snagged the next waiter to walk through the entrance and took his tray. The sweet-faced college kid seemed startled and alarmed to have the chief planner for this event grabbing him by the arm. &#x201c;You, get two of your coworkers and very quickly, very quietly, very discreetly get that shrimp tower out of here. If anyone asks, just tell them that you&#x2019;re taking it back to the kitchen to be refilled.&#x201d;<br> <br>The poor boy blanched at the brisk clip to her tone and said, &#x201c;But&#x2014;but Chef Jean was very specific about&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what Chef Jean was specific about,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Get it out of here now.&#x201d;<br> <br>The waiter nodded and pulled away from her into the gathering crowd.<br> <br>Margot stepped forward into the fragrant warmth of the greenhouse, careful to keep her expression and body language relaxed. She was aware that, while professionally dressed in her black power suit, she was not nearly as festive as the guests in their tuxedos and haute couture gowns, but she was perfectly comfortable. She&#x2019;d attended hundreds of events like this growing up. She would not be intimidated by some plants and a pretentious wannabe Frenchman. She pressed the button of her earbud-size Bluetooth and whispered, &#x201c;This is Margot. I need to speak to Jean.&#x201d;<br> <br>She could tell by the way her words were echoing in her own ear that the head chef of Fete Portable had taken his earpiece out&#x2014;despite Margot&#x2019;s repeated requests to keep a line of communication open with her&#x2014;and set it on the stainless steel counter in the makeshift kitchen. She blew out a frustrated breath. Jean LeDille was not her preferred caterer for high-profile events, but the de facto hostess of tonight&#x2019;s opening&#x2014;Melissa Sutter, first lady of Chicago and head of the botanical garden conservators&#x2019; board&#x2014;had insisted on using him. So far he&#x2019;d been temperamental, resistant to the most basic instruction, and a pain in Margot&#x2019;s Calvin Klein&#x2013;clad ass. And when she was done with this event and had secured her partnership at Elite Elegance, she would have Jean blacklisted from every Chicago party planner&#x2019;s contact list. Theirs was a close-knit and gossip-driven circle.<br> <br>Someone in the kitchen picked up the earbud and said, &#x201c;Ms. Cary, he says to tell you he&#x2019;s unavailable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Margot gritted her perfect white teeth but managed a polite smile to the head of the opera board and his wife as they passed. Jean wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get a job making a clown-shaped birthday cake by the time she was done with him.<br> <br>&#x201c;So I guess I&#x2019;ll just have to make myself available to him, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>Margot&#x2019;s assistant, Mandy, a sleek brunette who reminded Margot of a Russian wolfhound in four-inch heels, fell in step behind her. &#x201c;Make sure that tower is gone. You have two minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On it,&#x201d; Mandy snapped, and peeled off after the hapless waiters.<br> <br>Margot pushed through the heavy plastic curtain that separated the greenhouse from the kitchen tent. Far from the muted music and golden-green light of the greenhouse, the tent was ruthlessly lit with fluorescents and heating lamps. Jean&#x2019;s shouts filled the air, demanding that the canapï¿½ trays be restocked tout de suite.<br> <br>Jean was a stocky, balding man with thick, dark eyebrows and an unfortunate mustache. His chef whites were splattered with various sauces and he sneered&#x2014;actually sneered&#x2014;at Margot as she walked into his kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing in ma&#x2019; kitchen?&#x201d; he demanded in an exaggerated French accent. &#x201c;I tell you before. No outside staff when I am creating.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jean, would you explain to me why there is a shrimp tower in the middle of my venue?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was overcome by the muse this morning. I decide to build you a shrimp tower. Only four hundred dollars extra. I do you favor, eh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait. Is that shrimp salad on the crostini?&#x201d; Margot asked, stopping a waiter before he left with his tray of appetizers. &#x201c;Because we agreed on poached quail eggs. Mrs. Sutter, the hostess of tonight&#x2019;s event, whom you&#x2019;ve cooked for on several occasions, is allergic to shrimp. As in, she can&#x2019;t even be around people who are eating shrimp because she might come into contact with the proteins. I wrote it on everything. Everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>Margot motioned to the field refrigeration unit where she had taped a neon-green sign that read PLEASE REMEMBER THAT MRS. SUTTER IS HIGHLY ALLERGIC TO SHRIMP.<br> <br>Jean waved her off. &#x201c;I do not read the cards. My sous chef reads the cards.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jean. Drop the French accent that we both know is about as real as that ridiculous hairpiece and tell me what you are feeding the mayor&#x2019;s wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>The chef, whose real name was John Dill, shrugged and in his natural, Midwestern voice said, &#x201c;The market didn&#x2019;t have enough quail eggs, so I took the shrimp. It&#x2019;s not a big deal. If she&#x2019;s allergic, she&#x2019;ll know not to touch it. People make too much of their food allergies anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just lovely to know that someone with that attitude is making food for innocent bystanders,&#x201d; Margot snapped. She called out loud enough for the entire kitchen staff to hear, &#x201c;Eighty-six the shrimp crostini. Throw them out and take the bags out of the tent. All of you wash your hands&#x2014;twice&#x2014;and any utensils that have touched the shrimp&#x2014;also twice. I need one uncontaminated staff member to make a special shrimp-free plate of food for Mrs. Sutter so we can feed her tonight without poisoning her. Get it done, now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jean was seething, but Margot didn&#x2019;t give a single damn. Mandy popped through the plastic curtain, a stricken expression on her angular face.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a problem with the tower,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too heavy to move. But they&#x2019;re working on disassembling the shrimp trays to bring them back in before people notice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if it&#x2019;s made of concrete. I need it&#x2014;&#x201d; Margot&#x2019;s response was cut short by a strange honking ruckus from the greenhouse, followed by screams and crashing . . . and running?<br> <br>One of Margot&#x2019;s golden eyebrows rose. &#x201c;What is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mandy grimaced. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t flamingos eat shrimp?&#x201d;<br> <br>Margot dropped her clipboard and her headset to the ground and scrambled through the plastic curtain. &#x201c;Oh, no.&#x201d;<br> <br>The flamingos were making a run at the shrimp tower, pink wings flapping, pecking at the waiters who were attempting to remove the shellfish. The guests were falling all over one another trying to get away from the shrimp-frenzied birds and in the process had knocked over several cocktail tables and the votive candles on top. Those candles had set fire to the tablecloths, which set off the greenhouse&#x2019;s sprinklers and alarms. The parrots did not appreciate the clanging alarms or the sudden scramble of people. They broke free from their perches and were flying around the greenhouse, leaving &#x201c;deposits&#x201d; on the guests in protest. Oh, and Mrs. Sutter was purple and covered in hives.<br> <br>Margot gave herself ten seconds to surrender to the panic. She let her stomach churn. She let her ice-cold hands shake. She allowed herself to hear everything and nothing all at once. In her head, she saw her career going up in flames with the tablecloths. The promotion and partnership she&#x2019;d worked for were disappearing before her eyes in puffs of smoke. Everything she&#x2019;d planned, everything she wanted in life, was slipping out of her fingers because of some misplaced shellfish.<br> <br>And then Margot put a lid on her anxiety and did what she did best. She put out fires metaphorical and literal. She called an ambulance and the fire department, grabbed the EpiPen from Mrs. Sutter&#x2019;s purse, and jabbed her in the thigh. Hell, she even took off her pumps and wrangled the shrimp-seeking flamingos back into the lagoon.<br> <br>But the damage was done. The news photographers who&#x2019;d prepared themselves for a boring evening shooting glamour poses gleefully snapped photos of society matrons in soaked designer gowns and runny makeup dashing for shelter from the sprinklers. A guest who happened to be a member of PETA started screaming at Margot for mistreating the flamingos while trying to herd them away from (attacking) the guests. And a conservators&#x2019; board member handed her an invoice for the thousands of dollars in rare orchid species that had been trampled in the melee.<br> <br>The next morning, an exhausted Margot sat slumped in the offices of Elite Elegance as her boss, Carrington Carter-Shaw, slapped newspapers with headlines like FLORAL FIASCO and REAL-LIFE ANGRY BIRDS! on her desk. One particularly cheeky tabloid had printed a picture of Margot beating the smoldering remains of a matron&#x2019;s hairpiece with a wet napkin under the headline FLOWER POWER F***-UP!<br> <br>&#x201c;How could you let this happen?&#x201d; Carrington cried, her carefully blown-out dark hair dancing around her heart-shaped face. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re the laughingstock of the Chicago social scene. Guests from last night are trying to stick us with dry-cleaning bills, medical bills&#x2014;Michelle Biederman claims a parrot flew off with her two-karat diamond earring! The mayor&#x2019;s office has contacted us&#x2014;twice&#x2014;to call our business license into question. I had to move three guys from the mail room just to handle the incoming phone calls. Margot, you&#x2019;re my star! My rock! You can make a backyard potluck birthday party look like a black-tie gala. You&#x2019;re the planner I call when it&#x2019;s clear in the first meeting that the client is absolutely batshit insane. What happened?&#x201d;<br> <br>Margot wanted to blame the untested Chef Jean and his &#x201c;inspired&#x201d; impromptu shrimp, but ultimately the fault rested with her. She&#x2019;d lost control of the party. She&#x2019;d lost control of the food. She&#x2019;d lost control of two dozen species of birds.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Margot mumbled, shaking her head. She took a prepackaged stain wipe out of her Prada clutch and dabbed at a questionable blotch on her lapel. &#x201c;It all happened so quickly. I&#x2014;I know, at this point, the partnership is off the table&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Partnership?&#x201d; Carrington scoffed. &#x201c;Honey, I can&#x2019;t even keep you on staff. You&#x2019;re professional poison. I&#x2019;m going to have to fire you and do it in a very public manner&#x2014;I mean, picture the polite urban equivalent of putting you in stocks in the town square and pelting you with rotten fruit&#x2014;so people know that our company is safe to use again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Margot let loose a breath she didn&#x2019;t know she&#x2019;d been holding. She nodded. In some way, she&#x2019;d been expecting this. She knew it would be rough for a while and she would have to put off some bullet points in her five-year plan, but she could handle this. She had contingency funds and a secret contact list of important people who owed her favors.<br> <br>Margot cleared her throat and tried to straighten her rumpled suit jacket. &#x201c;And what, you&#x2019;ll shuffle me out to one of the branch offices in the suburbs and I&#x2019;ll organize bar mitzvahs until this all blows over?&#x201d;<br> <br>Carrington frowned. &#x201c;No, Margot. Fired. As in employment permanently terminated. The partners are willing to give you a three-week severance in recognition of the work you&#x2019;ve done for us. And I&#x2019;ll write you a positive recommendation letter. But that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve worked here for almost ten years. I&#x2019;ve put in eighty-hour weeks. Ninety during the holiday party season. I don&#x2019;t have a social life because I&#x2019;m always here. I haven&#x2019;t been on a date in more than eight months.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I know. That&#x2019;s why you get the third week of severance pay. Really, Margot, I think we&#x2019;re being more than generous here, considering the fallout from this fiasco.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Margot walked out of Elite Elegance&#x2019;s plush offices with a banker&#x2019;s box full of her belongings and a severance check in hand, she told herself that it would be okay, that this was what backup plans were for, that this situation couldn&#x2019;t possibly get worse.<br> <br>It got worse.<br> <br>Stage one of Margot&#x2019;s plan had been to retreat to her apartment to regroup, polish up her rï¿½sumï¿½, and compose a list of companies she could apply to, but her unit&#x2019;s new tenants kept stopping by to measure for new flooring and curtains. Just a week before the &#x201c;Floral Fiasco,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d given up her lease in preparation to move to a newly purchased condo in Wicker Park. Between the down payment she&#x2019;d saved and the raise she was supposed to get with her promotion, she would have been able to afford it. But the day after she was fired, she&#x2019;d gotten a call from the mortgage officer handling her condo loan. Mrs. Meade had seen the news about the greenhouse incident and her firing, and informed Margot that without a job, the mortgage company could not guaran...</p><h2>The Eltingville Club</h2><p>Take-no-prisoners trivia-offs.

His most well-known works are the comic books <i>Milk and Cheese</i> and <i>Dork</i>. His comics often poke fun at fandom, even while making it clear that Dorkin is a fan himself. As well as his comics work, Dorkin has also written for animation, including (with his wife Sarah Dyer, also a comics writer/artist, married) <i>Space Ghost: Coast to Coast</i>. He also wrote and produced <i>Bring me the Head of Boba Fett</i>, an animated television pilot for Adult Swim called Welcome to Eltingville, based on his own characters. Dorkin and Dyer also wrote some episodes of the Superman animated series, particularly the episode "Live Wire," which introduced a new character of the same name. Additionally, the pair contributed to the script of the 2006 English-language version of the anime <i>Shin Chan</i>. After an initial six-episode order proved successful, more episodes were ordered, but Dorkin and Dyer are no longer working on the series. They had also been developing a pilot for a series entitled "Tyrone's Inferno" for Adult Swim for the last few years, but according to <i>Dorkin's LiveJournal</i> the project is dead.

Since its 2009 launch, the Kepler satellite has discovered more than two thousand exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system. More exoplanets are being discovered all the time, and even more remarkable than the sheer number of exoplanets is their variety. In <i>Exoplanets</i>, astronomer Michael Summers and physicist James Trefil explore these remarkable recent discoveries: planets revolving around pulsars, planets made of diamond, planets that are mostly water, and numerous rogue planets wandering through the emptiness of space. This captivating book reveals the latest discoveries and argues that the incredible richness and complexity we are finding necessitates a change in our questions and mental paradigms. In short, we have to change how we think about the universe and our place in it, because it is stranger and more interesting than we could have imagined.</p><p>MICHAEL SUMMERS is a planetary scientist and professor of physics and astronomy at George Mason University. Since 1989, he has served on the mission teams of several NASA space probes in the role of science planning and interpretation of spacecraft observations. He is currently a coinvestigator on the NASA New Horizons mission to the Pluto-Charon double planet, where he serves as the deputy lead of the Atmospheres Theme Team. JAMES TREFIL is Clarence J. Robinson Professor of Physics at George Mason University. He has written more than 50 books on science for a general audience. His writing has won the American Institute of Physics Science Writing Award, the American Association for the Advancement of Science Westinghouse Science Journalism Award, and other honors.<b>BOOKLIST, Starred Review<br></b>The existence of planets outside Earth&#x2019;s solar system was long assumed, and recent technologies, including improved telescopes and research satellites, have not only confirmed their existence but revealed all kinds of surprises. The first verified exoplanet, for instance, was orbiting &#x201c;the wrong kind of star,&#x201d; a pulsar, or what was left after a supernova that was supposed to blast to smithereens anything even close to resembling a planet. Meanwhile, the statuses of solar system objects besides the recognized planets were changing as water, indispensable for Earth-like life, was detected as superficial ice and subsurface oceans on some moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune as well as on big bodies in the Kuiper Belt, such as the<br>demoted planet Pluto, which thereby regained its title. Astonishment continued as huge, rocky &#x201c;Super Earths,&#x201d; inexplicably light planets, pure-carbon diamond planets, planets circling more than one star, starhugging hot planets, and rogue planets unconnected to stars were detected. These revelations, how they were made, imaginative voyages to five un-Earthly types of planet, and their implications for life and intelligence elsewhere than on Earth are concisely illuminated by astrophysicists Summers and Trefil in this marvelously fascinating and wonderfully accessible illustrated book. &#x2014; Ray Olson<br><br><b>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY<br></b>Readers tour several bizarre worlds in this slim read, as Summers and Trefil, professors of physics at George Mason University, show how &#x201c;defining a &#x2018;planet&#x2019; has been made significantly more difficult&#x201d; in the exoplanet age. Astronomical investigations outside our celestial backyard are ripe with paradigm shifts because scientists suffered &#x201c;the curse of the single example&#x201d;: our solar system and carbon-based life. Detailed photos and illustrations aid &#x201c;visits&#x201d; to unusual worlds, including 55 Cancri e, where volcanoes spew liquid diamond; Kepler 186f, with its vast lagoons and black flora that absorb &#x201c;what energy they can from the faint sun&#x201d;; and a rogue planet wandering dark space, where any life &#x201c;must see in the infrared&#x201d; and be warmed by the planet&#x2019;s core. The authors temper runaway imaginations with scientific uncertainties about each location, and they reexamine the Drake equation&#x2014;used in the search for extraterrestrial life&#x2014;in light of our current understanding of exosystem frequency and dynamics. Summers and Trefil write confidently and straightforwardly for lay readers, who will long ponder what planets circle other suns and the peculiar possibilities of life beyond our blue marble. Illus. <b><br><br>KIRKUS REVIEW </b> <br>A comprehensive introduction to the thousands of newly discovered planets beyond our solar system, which are beautiful and mind-bending in their diversity&#x2014;and those are just the ones we know of.<br>Though astronomers had long predicted that there were other solar systems out there, only in the past decade has satellite telescope technology been able to confirm the existence of an enormous number of exoplanets, &#x201c;planets outside our solar system. Even more significant than their abundance is their diversity, and even more astonishing than their diversity is, in some cases, their very existence&#x2014;many of these worlds defy what scientists thought they knew about what was possible about how planets form and behave. Planetary scientist Summers (Physics and Astronomy/George Mason Univ.), who has been a member of multiple NASA mission teams, and Trefil (Physics/George Mason Univ.; <i>Space Atlas: Mapping the Universe and Beyond</i>, 2016, etc.) take readers on an exhilarating tour of the universe as we now know it. In a series of chapters that detail a variety of recently detected planets, the authors provide both a history of exoplanet discovery and a look toward the future of the field (which just may bear fruit in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence). &#x201c;If there really are rogue planets floating around just outside the solar systems,&#x201d; they write, then perhaps &#x201c;multigenerational starships...won&#x2019;t be needed to reach them.&#x201d; These otherworldly planets are dizzying in scope and are a wonderful feast for the imagination, even as the authors back up their imagery with the latest research findings. Also included are a number of photographs and illustrations that provide a welcome visual accompaniment to the lay-friendly text.<br> Space enthusiasts of all ages will enjoy this exploration into the farthest reaches of the universe and the cutting edge of astronomical research. <b><br><br>CHOICE<br></b>Summers and Trefil (both, George Mason Univ.) have written a short, entertaining book about the huge variety of extrasolar planetary types, many of which were not even dreamt of a decade ago. The authors explore characteristics of some types discovered and extrapolated, such as worlds covered in ice and water, worlds with volcanoes that erupt diamonds, and some not yet seen, such as rogues ejected from planetary systems during formation to wander the galaxy without a star. The authors devote the most important part of the book to two questions: Is there life elsewhere and can we recognize it? If so, is there intelligent life? They posit that the first question may be answered in the affirmative soon, as new telescopes begin the necessary observations. Yet the question about intelligent life may never be answered. The book has been written to avoid the obsolescence that rapid progress can bring about in this field.<b><br></b></p><h2>A Fool&#39;s Gold Christmas (Fool&#39;s Gold, Book 10)</h2><p>A classic heartwarming tale for the holidays from &nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Susan Mallery&nbsp;<br><br>The cheer in Fool's Gold, California, is bringing out the humbug in dancer Evie Stryker.

DEUTERONOMY 4:29 1 O God, you are my God, early will I seek you. My flesh longs for you, my soul thirsts for you, in a barren and dry land where there is no water. Psalm 63:1 2 Late have I loved you, O Beauty so ancient and so new. You called, and broke through my defences, and now I long for you. You breathed your fragrance on me, and I drew in my breath and now I pant for you. I tasted you, and now I hunger and thirst for you. You touched me, and I burn for your peace. St Augustine of Hippo (354&#x2013;430) 3 Lord Jesus, I am not an eagle. All I have are the eyes and the heart of one. In spite of my littleness, I dare to gaze at the sun of love, and I long to fly towards it. St Thï¿½rï¿½se of Lisieux (1873&#x2013;1897) 4 Holy Spirit dwell in me, that I may become prayer. Whether I sleep or wake, eat or drink, labour or rest, may the fragrance of prayer rise, without effort, in my heart. Purify my soul and never leave me, so that the movements of my heart and mind may, with voices full of sweetness, sing in secret to God. after St Isaac the Syrian (seventh century) 5 O sweetest love of God, too little known, whoever has found you will be at rest. Let everything change, O my God, that I may rest in you. How sweet to me is your presence, you who are the sovereign good! I will draw near to you in silence, and will uncover your feet, that it may please you to unite me with yourself, making my soul your bride. I will rejoice in nothing until I am in your arms; O Lord, I beseech you, leave me not for a moment. St John of the Cross (1542&#x2013;1591) 6 Lord, this moment is yours; mine for you, and yours for me. I need you, I cannot survive without you; and yet I go on rushing through life as if I could do everything in my own strength. Forgive me. I know that you care for me at all times, and that I am always in your hands; but I still need to pause and let my heart and spirit be loved by you into loving you again.

Reviewers are simply agog over <i>Lord of the Silent, </i>calling it, &#x201c;Wonderfully entertaining&#x201d; (<i>Washington Times</i>), &#x201c;Deeply satisfying&#x201d;&nbsp; (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>), and in the words of the <i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i>, &#x201c;The hype is true. This is Peters&#x2019;s best book.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Amelia Peabody Emerson is the Mary Poppins of Egypt. Forthright, intrepid, and industrious, she brooks no nonsense from anyone and is armed with an apparently magical parasol. As the legions of fans of Elizabeth Peters's Edwardian archeological mystery series know, Amelia is also possessed of a swift temper, an incorrigible curiosity, and an uncanny proclivity for attracting trouble. But in 1915, with the world gripped by the madness of war, trouble is endemic. In an effort to prevent their son Ramses from being coerced into working for British intelligence (in the sort of endeavor that nearly got him killed a year earlier when he infiltrated a band of Egyptian nationalists and prevented a Turkish-backed uprising), Amelia and husband Emerson and the rest of their dizzyingly large entourage flee England for the reassuringly stoic splendor of their beloved Egyptian ruins.<p> So much for a quiet dig among the mastabas. With their usual luck, the family promptly finds itself inundated by would-be assassins and nosy journalists. Amelia quickly deduces that Ramses's undercover work is at the root of both threat and curiosity; more puzzling is the appearance of the odd corpse or two and a rash of stunningly efficient tomb robberies. When Ramses and his wife, Nefret, travel to Luxor to check on the security of some of their old excavations, they find an all-too-familiar irritant behind the robberies. It would be telling to reveal his identity, but fans of the series will soon figure it out, with the aid of a little suspension of disbelief. With Ramses and Nefret on one hand, and Amelia and Emerson on the other, engaged in "protecting" the other side from conflict and trouble, the novel unfolds in a merry chase of misdirection and miscommunication.</p><p> There is a comforting consistency to Peters's series. By now, all of the characters' quirks are etched in stone like so many well-worn hieroglyphs. Amelia's narrative has the familiarity of a treasured and oft-read letter from a slightly batty aunt. Even the miraculous return of (no, I <i>really</i> can't say), though perhaps intended as a radical plot twist, adheres to the most genteel of mystery traditions, ï¿½ la Doyle and Christie. Innovation can be overrated; with Peters's flawless record of producing amusing, easily digested novels showing no signs of faltering, fans should devour this morsel--and wait impatiently for the next tasty installment. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p><p>The ghosts of an ancient past and the specters of a present-day evil are buried beneath the Egyptian sands . . .</p><p>For archaeologist Amelia Peabody and her family, the allure of Egypt remains as powerful as ever, even in 1915, as a World War rages. But nowhere in this exotic land is safe&#x2014;especially for Amelia's son Ramses and his beautiful new wife Nefret. Treachery and danger pursue the two young lovers across the desert nation, strengthening a bond of passion and devotion that only death can sever. And the grim discovery of a recent corpse in a tomb where it does not belong is pulling Amelia deeper into a storm of intrigue, corruption, kidnapping, and murder&#x2014;and toward dark revelations that threaten to awaken the past . . . and alter the family's destiny.</p></p><h2>When Women Played Hardball</h2><p><b>"Susan Johnson has created a literary grand slam!"--Billie Jean King<br><br></b>The years between 1943 and 1954 marked the magical era of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League--which proved beyond doubt that women can play hardball.

This is a story about memories, about dreams fulfilled and dreams denied. It is a celebration of a brief yet remarkable period when women truly had &#34;A League of Their Own&#34;.Several years ago the movie A League of Their Own alerted many Americans for the first time to the existence of the All-American Girls Baseball League, which existed from 1943 to 1954. Johnson's thorough history captures the intensity and &#x201a;lan of the league. The author shows how the league progressed from a wartime, morale-building softball league (brainchild of Philip Wrigley, the owner of the Chicago Cubs) to a postwar hardball league, with players just as gritty as their big-league male counterparts. Johnson conducted 26 interviews of women who played for the 1950 Rockford Peaches and Fort Wayne Daisies, the two teams who fought it out for the league championship. As the interviews illustrate, the league stressed ``high moral standing'' and femininity and rigidly enforced its rules by making players attend a ``Charm School'' where they were taught such ladylike things as applying make-up--which they were made to wear on the field. When not playing, the women were kept under the sharp eye of a chaperone. But there were advantages--the women were doing something they loved, and the pay could be very good. The chapters profiling players are reminiscent of Studs Terkel's interview method: direct, informative, revealing. Marilyn ``Jonesy'' Jones, a catcher, recalls her trouble with catching pop flies--and shows the formerly broken fingers to prove it; ``Willie'' Briggs tells how Hall-of- Famer Max Carey made her a successful base stealer and reminds us just how skillful players must be. Johnson also touches on the homosexuality issue (there was some, but, even now, it's a discreet subject) and just how tough some players were: one woman played until she was four months pregnant. This book will be enjoyed not only by the admirers of the All- American Girls Baseball League, but by baseball fans in general. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In the modern period, the spiritual sense gradually became marginalized in favor of the literal sense. The Bible came to be read and interpreted like any other book. This brief, accessible introduction to the history of biblical interpretation examines key turning points and figures and argues for a retrieval of the premodern spiritual habits of reading Scripture.</p><p>"This helpful introductory overview of the history of biblical interpretation is a real achievement, punctuated as it is with significant insights, robust critique, and sympathetic assessment. The climax is a brave attempt to be like the scribe who brings out of his treasure things both old and new. Readers should be enticed into further exploration and experiment."<br>--<b>Frances Young</b>, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom<br><br>"Stanglin's history of biblical interpretation is a gem! Accessible, well informed, and balanced, it provides a remarkable bird's-eye view while at the same time zooming in on specific exegetical examples. Stanglin's analysis of the move from premodern to modern exegesis is retrieval theology at its best."<br>--<b>Hans Boersma</b>, Regent College<br><br>"This book provides a compelling overview of how the tradition has been aware of the necessity of a more than (but not less than) literal reading of the Bible. It offers insight into what was at stake in the decades just prior to the rise of the critical methods applied to the Bible, and it speaks up for the unfashionable vocation of the exegete-theologian. Heartily recommended."<br>--<b>Mark&nbsp;W. Elliott</b>, University of St.&nbsp;Andrews<br><br>"Critical biblical scholars have long scoffed at the excesses of premodern allegorists. Theological interpreters have recently returned the favor, scoffing at the reductionism of critical readers. Stanglin's history of Christian interpretation cuts through the polemics. He not only demonstrates the superiority of premodern interpretation but also shows the real gains (and losses) of modern scholarship. An outstanding contribution and a welcome addition to any course on biblical hermeneutics."<br>--<b>Peter Leithart</b>, Theopolis Institute<br><br>"Interest in premodern ways of reading the Bible has grown so quickly that we now require direction through the territory. Stanglin's guide should become preeminent in the genre. His lucid overview gets at the deeper motives and methods that have shaped traditional ways of reading Scripture. A superb book for students, pastors, and all thoughtful Christians."<br>--<b>Ephraim Radner</b>, Wycliffe College, University of Toronto<br><br>"In this lively and accessible introduction, Stanglin makes a strong case for the exegetical value of the history of interpretation. Readers will learn a great deal from his skillful and sure-footed review of ancient, medieval, and modern interpreters, and they will be challenged by his call for a more balanced--and more profound--engagement with the Bible."<br>--<b>Michael Legaspi</b>, Penn State University<b>Keith D.

And even though it&#x2019;s an autoimmune disease, it&#x2019;s also way more than an immune system problem. Over time, it progressively becomes a body-wide disorder.Most people are familiar with the common hypothyroid symptoms of fatigue, brain fog, weight gain, sensitivity to cold, hair loss, and constipation. But what many people don&#x2019;t seem to understand is that many Hashimoto&#x2019;s patients also have anxiety and depression, acid reflux, blood sugar imbalances like hypoglycemia and insulin resistance, intestinal permeability, anemia, food intolerances, and much more.This is not coincidence. It is all caused by repeated patterns of one system of the body breaking down and bringing other systems down with it. This causes vicious cycles that lead to the breakdown of the gut, the brain, the adrenals, the stomach, the gall bladder, the liver and every other major organ in the body.How to Heal Hashimoto&#x2019;s offers a practical, easy-to-follow approach that treats the whole body, by figuring out what is breaking down and then developing a plan for fixing it.

First published in 1979, this was the first of Robert Munsch&#x2019;s oral stories to be turned into a book. Since then, it has made countless children (and adults) all around the world laugh out loud. When Jule Ann goes outside, a mud puddle jumps on her and gets her dirty all over. No sooner does her mother scrub her clean than she ventures out again, only to be pounced upon by the pesky mud puddle. The cycle continues until finally Jule Ann gets the better of the mud puddle with cheerful ingenuity and two bars of smelly yellow soap.

After her mother brings Julie Ann clean new clothes, she buttons them up carefully and walks outside, where a mud puddle jumps on her&#x2013;&#x2013;from a tree, a gutter&#x2014;again and again. The spacious line-and-watercolor pictures with lots of white space show Julie Ann neat and tidy, then completely filthy, even up her nose. Perhaps worst of all, Mom scrubs off all the mud in the bath until Julie Ann is red all over. Finally, Julie Ann works out a great defense; she lures the mud puddle and destroys him with a bar of yellow soap. As much as the small kid&#x2019;s triumph, young preschoolers will love the mucky action and detail.

There is perhaps no better person in recent history to answer this question than Charles Finney. Finney (1792-1875) was the most powerful Christian preacher of the 1800s who sought to clearly articulate what the Scriptures say about living the true Christian life that pleases God. He fearlessly challenged his hearers to bring every aspect of their lives into obedience to God. This book contains sixteen messages of Finney that describe the essential practice of Christianity.

She&#x2019;s proud of her house and has lots of fun using her imagination to play with it&#x2014;until she discovers her friend Sophie&#x2019;s &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; storebought house. Sophie thinks her house, with everything matching and even a toilet seat that goes up and down, is pretty perfect too, until both girls discover that the narrator&#x2019;s handmade dollhouse is really a lot more fun.<br><br>"Celebrates the best of free play, capturing what it's like to be fully engaged and inspired." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times<br><br></i>"Readers will feel right at home with this cozy tribute to imagination." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews,</i> Starred<br><br>"The realization that creative, outside-the-box artistry can be more inspiring than anything manufactured makes for a wonderful story." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly,</i> Starred</p><p>Giselle Potter has illustrated numerous books for children, including <i>Cecil the Pet Glacier</i> by Matthea Harvey, <i>Want to Be in a Band?</i> by Suzzy Roche, and <i>The Boy Who Loved Words</i> by Roni Schotter, which was a Parents&#x2019; Choice Gold Award winner. Giselle lives in New York&#x2019;s Hudson Valley with her husband and daughters. Visit her at GisellePotter.com.K-Gr 3&#x2014;"This is my dollhouse. It used to be a cardboard box." As the narrator takes readers on an inspiring tour, her handmade dollhouse will captivate young artists, architects, and miniature enthusiasts. She introduces the eclectic family who lives there and shows how she makes the furniture out of everyday objects. A hole in a small box makes a television with a changeable picture, and cut yarn in a bottle cap makes a plate of noodles. "The rug is a small piece of carpet I cut off the one in my room. (So far, no one has noticed.)" The dolls have a Dixie cup elevator and a bowl for a rooftop pool. Engaging spreads and spot art bring out the dollhouse's whimsy while also providing a few visual how-tos. In stark contrast, the narrator's friend's store-bought dollhouse is "all perfect." At Sophie's, the two girls struggle to find a way to play together as Sophie resists any unusual improvisation around her unalterable dollhouse. The narrator becomes shy about her creative impulses and later her own dollhouse, which she hides when Sophie comes over. Ultimately the handmade dollhouse is discovered, and Sophie becomes caught up in its creation and the imaginative play it engages. The illustrations done in watercolor and ink have a folk-art style that honors the spirit of arts and crafts. Those who want to build their own dollhouse will find illustrated ideas from the book with basic instructions and suggestions under the book's jacket.

This professional resource can help change the way special educators view the IEP, from a burdensome process to an extremely valuable document. This book focuses on both the art and science of writing a strong IEP. New practice exercises provide teachers the opportunity to discern whether an IEP goal is either measurable or not measurable and to give reasons why. Other exercises ask teachers to identify unique needs, write annual goals, and create short-term objectives. With sample present levels of performance given, teachers must be able to identify two unique needs, write a measurable annual goal, and three short-term objectives for each need. With the updated content and new teacher activities, the 2019 edition of Writing Measurable IEP Goals and Objectives is an invaluable resource for all special education staff.</p><p>Barbara Bateman, PhD, is a nationally recognized expert in special education and in special education law.

His interviews with the last American World War I veterans&#x2014;who have all since died&#x2014;bring to vivid life a cataclysm that changed our world forever but that remains curiously forgotten here.&#x201d;&#x2014;Adam Hochschild, author of <i>To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914&#x2013;1918<br></i><br>In 2003, 85 years after the end of World War I, Richard Rubin set out to see if he could still find and talk to someone who had actually served in the American Expeditionary Forces during that colossal conflict. Ultimately, he found dozens, aged 101 to 113, from Cape Cod to Carson City, who shared with him at the last possible moment their stories of America&#x2019;s Great War. Nineteenth-century men and women living in the twenty-first century, they were self-reliant, humble, and stoic, never complaining, but still marveling at the immensity of the war they helped win, and the complexity of the world they helped create. Though America has largely forgotten their war, you will never forget them, or their stories. A decade in the making, <i>The Last of the Doughboys</i> is the most sweeping look at America&#x2019;s First World War in a generation, a glorious reminder of the tremendously important role America played in the war to end all wars, as well as a moving meditation on character, grace, aging, and memory.<br><br>&#x201c;An outstanding and fascinating book. By tracking down the last surviving veterans of the First World War and interviewing them with sympathy and skill, Richard Rubin has produced a first-rate work of reporting.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ian Frazier, author of <i>Travels in Siberia</i><br><br>&#x201c;I cannot remember a book about that huge and terrible war that I have enjoyed reading more in many years."&#x2014;Michael Korda, <i>The Daily Beast</i></p><p>RICHARD RUBIN is the author of <i>Confederacy of Silence</i>. In addition to the <i>Atlantic</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, he has written for <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Smithsonian</i>, <i>New York</i> magazine, and <i>Parade</i>. <br>In 2003, 85 years after the armistice, it took Richard Rubin months to find just one living American veteran of World War I. But then, he found another. And another. Eventually he managed to find dozens, aged 101 to 113, and interview them. All are gone now.<br><br>A decade-long odyssey to recover the story of a forgotten generation and their Great War led Rubin across the United States and France, through archives, private collections, and battlefields, literature, propaganda, and even music. But at the center of it all were the last of the last, the men and women he met: a new immigrant, drafted and sent to France, whose life was saved by a horse; a Connecticut Yankee who volunteered and fought in every major American battle; a Cajun artilleryman nearly killed by a German aeroplane; an 18-year-old Bronx girl &#x201c;drafted&#x201d; to work for the War Department; a machine-gunner from Montana; a Marine wounded at Belleau Wood; the 16-year-old who became America&#x2019;s last WWI veteran; and many, many more. <br><br>They were the final survivors of the millions who made up the American Expeditionary Forces, nineteenth-century men and women living in the twenty-first century. Self-reliant, humble, and stoic, they kept their stories to themselves for a lifetime, then shared them at the last possible moment, so that they, and the World War they won &#x2013; the trauma that created our modern world &#x2013; might at last be remembered.

Craughwell takes us on one of the most exciting&nbsp;archaeological finds of the twentieth century.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1448 a team of architects and engineers brought Pope Nicholas V unhappy news: the 1,100-year-old Basilica of St. Peter suffered from so many structural defects that it was beyond repair. The only solution was to pull down the old church--one of the most venerable churches in all of Christiandom--and erect a new basilica on the site. Incredibly, one of the tombs the builders paved over was the resting place of St. Peter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in 1939, while reconstructing the grottoes below St. Peter's Basilica, a workman's shovel struck not dirt or rock but open air. After inspecting what could be seen through the hole they'd made in the mausoleum's roof, Pope Pius XII secretly authorized a full-scale excavation. What lay beneath? The answer and the adventure await. In this riveting history, facts, traditions, and faith collide to reveal the investigation, betrayals, and mystery behind St. Peter's burial place.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Thomas J. Craughwell</b></p> <p><strong>Q. You&#x2019;ve written a couple books on saints and one on relics. What is it that first drew you to this topic?</strong></p> <p>A. I&#x2019;ve been studying and publishing about the saints for thirty years. Naturally, if you study the saints, relics will be part of the picture.</p> <p><strong>Q. What inspired you to write <i>St. Peter&#x2019;s Bones</i>?</strong></p> <p>A. I became especially interested in the story of the rediscovery of St. Peter&#x2019;s relics after a 2006 visit to Rome, when I toured the Scavi, the excavations below St. Peter&#x2019;s Basilica where the tomb of St. Peter is located. Through a glass door, I could see his bones. It was an unforgettable experience and led me to write this book.</p> <p><strong>Q. What do you hope readers will take away from <i>St. Peter&#x2019;s Bones</i>?</strong></p> <p>A. I hope they find, as I did, that this is an Indiana Jones story, a quest for something priceless that was lost and then found.</p> <p><strong>Q. How did you go about researching this subject?</strong></p> <p>A. Several of the archaeologists involved in the excavation published accounts of their finds, and fortunately Fairfield University library (about 30 minutes from my house) had English translations of these books. Margherita Guarducci, the specialist in ancient inscriptions, also wrote about her findings, and her book is available online.</p> <p><strong>Q. Did you discover anything that was particularly surprising? </strong></p> <p>A. It was interesting to learn that were tensions among the archaeologists, and ever greater tension between the archaeologists and Msgr. Ludwig Kaas, the administrator of St. Peter&#x2019;s Basilica. You would think they would all work together like a well-oiled machine, but human foibles emerged even among people who were at the top of their field and involved in one of the most significant archaeological digs in history.</p>THOMAS J.

Lewis</h2><p>In early 2000, Mere Christianity was named by Christianity Today as the most influential Christian book of the Twentieth Century. But many people today are reluctant to read this magnificent classic. Why is this? I think many people are intimidated by C. S. Lewis&#39; academic credentials and impressive resume--they think they might not be up to his intellectual arguments. And this is simply not true. It is a challenging read to be sure, but most people can, with a bit of effort, understand the book and be encouraged by it. With Lewis&#39; book and these discussion and study notes, you&#39;ll be able to follow these important concepts and enjoy discussing Lewis&#39; ideas and answering my questions--perhaps with a group of friends.</p><p>Dr. Joseph McRae Mellichamp is Emeritus Professor of Management Science in the Graduate School of Business at the University of Alabama where he served as a faculty member from 1969 to 1994.

His frenetic pace of ministry had earned him just one thing: greater pressure to do even more. He had fallen for the soul-killing lie that doing more for God would give his life meaning. Then the godly admonition of a spiritual director set this burned-out believer on a life-saving spiritual path. Sometimes the only way to get a new life is by running your old one completely into the ground.&nbsp;<br><br> This powerful story of a reawakened soul can be the story of every person who has pursued spiritual productivity over intimacy with God and come up empty. It&#x2019;s the story of reclaiming your soul and finding a home in the center of God&#x2019;s relentless love.

His frenetic pace of ministry had earned him just one thing: greater pressure to do even more. He had fallen for the soul-killing lie that doing more for God would give his life meaning. Then the godly admonition of a spiritual director set this burned-out believer on a life-saving spiritual path. <br>This powerful story of a reawakened soul can be the story of every person who has pursued spiritual productivity over intimacy with God and come up empty. It's the story of reclaiming your soul and finding a home in the center of God's relentless love. It's the journey from self-importance to God-importance. <br>The solution is not greater achievements for the kingdom of God. It's time to stop living "for God and start living "with God. <br>In this candid and achingly authentic book, Fil Anderson shares the healing insights that restored his spiritual compass and guided him back to God ... the God who specializes in filling empty souls. <br>""To the harried and the unharried, I pray that this book will minister to your heart in the profound way that it has blessed mine." --Brennan Manning <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Writing Movies: The Practical Guide to Creating Stellar Screenplays</h2><p><p>To break into the screenwriting game, you need a screenplay that is not just good, but great.

Field, M.D., former Director of High Risk Obstetrics, Sutter Medical Center, Santa Rosa, CA<br><br><br>Women who want a natural childbirth often feel compelled to choose between a home birth and a hospital birth. They want the warmth and comfort of home, but they also desire the security of the medical support available in the hospital. Kerr, a family physician who provides family-centered childbirths, tells families how they can have the best of both worlds. She had two children, one in a birthing center and one at home, and trained with Ina May Gaskin at The Farm before going to medical school at the University of California, Davis. Her book offers clear guidelines for integrative childbirth, emphasizing the "Five C's": choice, communication, continuity, confidence, and control. Parents learn how to choose a health-care provider and hospital that will partner with them for a fulfilling birth experience. Physicians learn how to work with patients and their families to make sure this happens. The stories of 15 families who have had "homebirth in the hospital" illustrate that it does work.

Dr. Kerr clearly illustrates with detailed examples how women and their clinicians can work through the challenges that are unique to each woman's individual birth. Caregivers and women will benefit by seeing how empowering and healthy normal and natural childbirth can be when using skillful hands-on maneuvers, instilling confidence and facilitating the woman's own ability to understand what her body can do, the choices she has, and the confidence to communicate her needs. This book is a significant contribution to modern and normal childbirth.<br>--Phyllis Klaus, MFT, LCSW co-author of The Doula Book<br><br><br>A much-needed book showing that women can have real choices in hospital childbirth, and that the key ingredient in their ability to give birth as they wish is the ideology, the wisdom, and the heart of the practitioner.

Her entire afternoon had been a mad rush, leaving the courthouse at two-thirty, picking up Robin at school, driving from Hohokus through the heavy traffic of Routes 17 and 4, then over the George Washington Bridge to Manhattan, finally parking the car and arriving at the doctor's office just in time for Robin's four o'clock appointment.</p> <p>Now, after all the rush, Kerry could only sit and wait to be summoned into the examining room, wishing that she'd been allowed to be with Robin while the stitches were removed. But the nurse had been adamant. "During a procedure, Dr. Smith will not permit anyone except the nurse in the room with a patient."</p> <p>"But she's only ten!" Kerry had protested, then had closed her lips and reminded herself that she should be grateful that Dr. Smith was the one who hadbeen called in after the accident. The nurses at St. Luke's-Roosevelt had assured her that he was a wonderful plastic surgeon. The emergency room doctor had even called him a miracle worker.</p> <p>Reflecting back on that day, a week ago, Kerry realized she still hadn't recovered from the shock of that phone call. She'd been working late in her office at the courthouse in Hackensack, preparing for the murder case she would be prosecuting, taking advantage of the fact that Robin's father, her ex-husband, Bob Kinellen, had unexpectedly invited Robin to see New York City's Big Apple Circus, followed by dinner.</p> <p>At six-thirty her phone had rung. It was Bob. There had been an accident. A van had rammed into his Jaguar while he was pulling out of the parking garage. Robin's face had been cut by flying glass. She'd been rushed to St. Luke's-Roosevelt, and a plastic surgeon had been called. Otherwise she seemed fine, although she was being examined for internal injuries.</p> <p>Remembering that terrible evening, Kerry shook her head. She tried to push out of her mind the agony of the hurried drive into New York, dry sobs shaking her body, her lips forming only one word, "please," her mind racing with the rest of the prayer, <i>Please God, don't let her die, she's all I have. Please, she's just a baby. Don't take her from me...</i></p> <p>Robin was already in surgery when Kerry had arrived at the hospital, so she had sat in the waiting room, Bob next to her -- with him but not with him. He had a wife and two other children now. Kerry could still feel the overwhelming sensation of relief she had experienced when Dr. Smith had finally appeared, and in a formal and oddly condescending manner had said, "Fortunately the lacerations did not deeply penetrate the dermis. Robin will not be scarred. I want to see her in my office in one week."</p> <p>The cuts proved to be her only injuries, and Robin had bounced back from the accident, missing only two days of school. She had seemed to be somewhat proud of her bandages. It was only today, on their way into New York for the appointment, that she'd sounded frightened when she asked, "I will be okay, won't I, Mom? I mean my face won't be all messed up?"</p> <p>With her wide blue eyes, oval face, high forehead and sculpted features, Robin was a beautiful child and the image of her father. Kerry had reassured her with a heartiness she hoped was truthful. Now, to distract herself, Kerry looked around the waiting room. It was tastefully furnished with several couches and chairs covered in a small floral print design. The lights were soft, the carpeting luxurious.</p> <p>A woman who appeared to be in her early forties, wearing a bandage across her nose, was among those waiting to be called inside. Another, who looked somewhat anxious, was confiding to her attractive companion: "Now that I'm here, I'm glad you made me come. You look fabulous."</p> <p>She does, Kerry thought as she self-consciously reached into her bag for her compact. Snapping it open, she examined herself in the mirror, deciding that today she looked every minute of her thirty-six years. She was aware that many people found her attractive, but still she remained self-conscious about her looks. She brushed the powder puff over the bridge of her nose, trying to cover the spray of detested freckles, studied her eyes and decided that whenever she was tired, as she was today, their hazel color changed from green to muddy brown. She tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear, then with a sigh closed the compact and smoothed back the half bang that needed trimming.</p> <p>Anxiously she fastened her gaze on the door that led to the examining rooms. Why was it taking so long to remove Robin's stitches? she wondered. Could there be complications?</p> <p>A moment later the door opened. Kerry looked up expectantly. Instead of Robin, however, there emerged a young woman who seemed to be in her mid-twenties, a cloud of dark hair framing the petulant beauty of her face.</p> <p>I wonder if she always looked like that, Kerry mused, as she studied the high cheekbones, straight nose, exquisitely shaped pouty lips, luminous eyes, arched brows.</p> <p>Perhaps sensing her gaze, the young woman looked quizzically at Kerry as she passed her.</p> <p>Kerry's throat tightened. I know you, she thought. But from where? She swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry. That face -- I've seen her before.</p> <p>Once the woman had left, Kerry went over to the receptionist and explained that she thought she might know the lady who just came out of the doctor's office. Who was she?</p> <p>The name Barbara Tompkins, however, meant nothing to her. She must have been mistaken. Still, when she sat down again, an overwhelming sense of dï¿½jï¿½ vu filled her mind. The effect was so chilling, she actually shivered.</p> <p>Copyright ï¿½ 1995 by Mary Higgins Clark</p></p><h2>Shadow Chaser (Son of Angels, Jonah Stone)</h2><p><p><strong>Join part angel Jonah Stone as he faces his biggest challenge yet!</strong></p><p>Many months have passed since part angel siblings Jonah, Eliza, and Jeremiah Stone began their angelic training.

But after years spent safely sticking to the training methods she knew, Becky was curious about how her counterparts in other countries approached the sport to which she&#x2019;d dedicated over half of her life. So in 2012, as a recipient of the Watson Fellowship, she packed four pairs of running shoes, cleared her schedule for the year, and took off on a journey to infiltrate diverse running communities around the world. What she encountered far exceeded her expectations and changed her outlook into the sport she loved.<br><br>Over the next twelve months&#x2014;visiting 9 countries with unique and storied running histories, logging over 3,500 miles running over trails, tracks, sidewalks, and dirt roads&#x2014;Becky explored the varied approaches of runners across the globe.

With the funding and support of the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, Wade packed a year&#x2019;s worth of running clothes and shoes; said good-bye to her family and friends; and took off on a solo exploration of global running cultures.</p>Wade&#x2019;s journey took her to England, Ireland, Switzerland, Ethiopia, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, and Finland, each country with a unique running history and a community of local athletes and coaches who welcomed her into their homes and onto their teams. Over the course of the year, she ran more than 3,500 miles as she experimented with diverse training styles and discovered new recovery techniques.

As anyone who has taught or raised young children knows, mathematical education for little kids is a real mystery. What are they capable of? What should they learn first? How hard should they work? Should they even &#34;work&#34; at all? Should we push them, or just let them be? There are no correct answers to these questions, and the author deals with them in classic math-circle style: he doesn&#39;t ask and then answer a question, but shows us a problem--be it mathematical or pedagogical--and describes to us what happened. His book is a narrative about what he did, what he tried, what worked, what failed, but most important, what the kids experienced. This book does not purport to show you how to create precocious high achievers. It is just one person&#39;s story about things he tried with a half-dozen young children. Mathematicians, psychologists, educators, parents, and everybody interested in the intellectual development in young children will find this book to be an invaluable, inspiring resource.

Although many have pointed to the lack of compassion and empathy in medical practice, few have considered the deeper philosophical, psychological, and ontological reasons for it. Piemonte fills that gap, examining why it is that clinicians and medical trainees largely evade issues of vulnerability and mortality and, doing so, offer patients compromised care. She argues that contemporary medical pedagogy and epistemology are not only shaped by the human tendency to flee from the reality of death and suffering but also perpetuate it. The root of the problem, she writes, is the educational and institutional culture that promotes reductionist understandings of care, illness, and suffering but avoids any authentic confrontation with human suffering and the fear and self-doubt that can come with that confrontation. Through a philosophical analysis of the patient-practitioner encounter, Piemonte argues that the doctor, in escaping from authentic engagement with a patient who is suffering, in fact &#x201c;escapes from herself.&#x201d;</p><p>Piemonte explores the epistemology and pedagogy of medicine, examines its focus on calculative or technical thinking, and considers how &#x201c;clinical detachment&#x201d; diminishes physicians. She suggests ways that educators might cultivate the capacity for authentic patient care and proposes specific curricular changes to help students expand their moral imaginations.</p></p><p>Nicole M. Piemonte is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medical Education at Creighton University, School of Medicine, and Academic Consultant at St. Joseph&#39;s Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix.<p>I am wholly refreshed by Nicole Piemonte's beautifully crafted argument. She shows precisely how medicine can be learned such that it opens doctors to acute sensitivity rather than hardening their hearts.</p>&#x2015;<b>Alan Bleakley</b>, Emeritus Professor of Medical Education and Medical Humanities, Plymouth University Peninsula School of Medicine; author of <i>Thinking with Metaphors in Medicine: The State of the Art</i><br><br><p>In this insightful book, Nicole M. Piemonte maintains that without a shared sense of vulnerability to the slings and arrows that flesh is heir to, encounters between patients and doctors are likely to amount to little more than transactional exchanges. She deftly demonstrates how studied attention to philosophical conceptions and literary representations of lived experiences of illness can transform such exchanges into healing encounters. <i>Afflicted </i>is a necessary addition to medical humanities literature and required reading for students who aspire to rewarding careers as caregivers.</p>&#x2015;<b>Ronald A. Carson</b>, Professor Emeritus, Institute for the Medical Humanities, University of Texas<br><br><p>Nicole Piemonte's <i>Afflicted</i> powerfully confronts a signature challenge in the delivery of healthcare: how to embrace and grapple with the suffering of both patient and physician. She argues that we cannot expect physicians simply to intuit how to care well for patients in the face of mutual vulnerability, or even to recognize their own vulnerability and so care well for themselves. Instead, medical educators must dare to humanize the practice of medicine throughout the formation of physicians. Philosophically accessible and clinically well-grounded, Afflicted integrates compelling stories with incisive analysis to create a sense of genuine hopefulness about the future of healthcare.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jason Scott Robert</b>, Lincoln Chair in Ethics, Arizona State University</p><h2>Life With My Guardian Angel</h2><p><p>Let's pretend that I was killed on that day, when I wasn't. &nbsp;</p> <p>The day when my guardian angel managed to throw my F-86F half a second from becoming a fireball in the desert, up into a clear sky, way above what would have been the impact point.</p> <p>If she hadn't done this, if she hadn't spared my life time after time in the 80-some years that we've been together, I wouldn't have written this book that brings those strange times together, and suggests why we choose any lifetime in the first place.</p> <p>For 78 of those years, I had no idea that she existed, hadn't heard about guardian angels and what their job might be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hadn't heard that our angel stays with us from the minute we're born till the time that our mission is done, and we come home to the place we call heaven.</p> <p>Today I've just about finished a lifetime, and at last I can understand what it is that we do as mortals, and why we choose these over all the other possibilities.</p> <p></p> <p>Thank you, dear guardian angel, and please consider that with your consent and signature, our contract will extend to yet another lifetime.</p></p><p><p>Richard Bachis the author of seventeen books, including <i>Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Illusions</i>, and <i>The Bridge Across Forever</i>.
